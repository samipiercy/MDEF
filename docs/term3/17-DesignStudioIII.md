### Intervention Proposals

*Playa x Plastic (Beach Clean)*

From the learnings of last term our proposal for an intervention is to collaborate with Clean Beach Initiative and Centro de la Playa around the topic of microplastics. In this way it would connect two organizations that are working around awareness and facilitating sustainable practices for the local Barcelona beaches. During this intervention we would show the prototype tools we developed to sort and collect microplastics. As well as, conduct a space for brainstorming to hear feedback about the tools, and to show existing litter awareness and tools. We would like this brainstorm to be a time for co-creation with other volunteers and to hear back from them what motivates them to clean the beach, what tools would be helpful, and how could both organizations be supported. It is also a time to bring awareness to microplastics in general and the variety of them that make their way into the Mediterranean. 


*Crafting Community*

We have been building weaving tools from open source designs, and collecting secondhand clothing to use as material. We have also been creating time to share and craft with others to promote non-productive creative spaces and to share knowledge with others. For our proposal, we would like to create an event that offers a community dye bath where community members can bring items they would like to re-fresh and give a new life to. During this event we also would like to have a small panel to talk about textiles and the sources of material. In general the event is to bring awareness to mixed textiles and the issues they are causing, sharing ways to resuse and upcycle, and to create an accessible craft event.
