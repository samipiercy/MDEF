### Intervention Proposals

*Playa x Plastic (Beach Clean)*

From the learnings of last term our proposal for an intervention is to collaborate with Clean Beach Initiative and Centro de la Playa around the topic of microplastics. In this way it would connect two organizations that are working around awareness and facilitating sustainable practices for the local Barcelona beaches. During this intervention we would show the prototype tools we developed to sort and collect microplastics. As well as, conduct a space for brainstorming to hear feedback about the tools, and to show existing litter awareness and tools. We would like this brainstorm to be a time for co-creation with other volunteers and to hear back from them what motivates them to clean the beach, what tools would be helpful, and how could both organizations be supported. It is also a time to bring awareness to microplastics in general and the variety of them that make their way into the Mediterranean. 


*Crafting Community*

We have been building weaving tools from open source designs, and collecting secondhand clothing to use as material. We have also been creating time to share and craft with others to promote non-productive creative spaces and to share knowledge with others. For our proposal, we would like to create an event that offers a community dye bath where community members can bring items they would like to re-fresh and give a new life to. During this event we also would like to have a small panel to talk about textiles and the sources of material. In general the event is to bring awareness to mixed textiles and the issues they are causing, sharing ways to resuse and upcycle, and to create an accessible craft event. 


### Alternative Presents 

*Updated Alternative Presents:*

**Playa x Plastic (Beach Clean)**

Community forms of waste removal such as beach clean ups can be a way to bring awareness to our waste consumption and empower local people to take action. Through working together we can discover and propose alternative futures that work with specific local needs.

Role: Communicating with volunteers and conducting brainstorming for feedback and conversation around beach plastic collection.

**Future Cravings**

Future Cravings is a methodology that makes space for difficult topics to live in a creative and interactive setting. It focuses on a specific climate issue and brings together people from various backgrounds fighting a similar cause. Through creating an immersive experience, Future Cravings provides a space for collaboration and inspiration outside of traditional spaces.

Role: Material development of biomaterials for tableware. Concept creation for proposals and project planning for each iteration.

**Crafting Community**

A space where people can slow down and make together, combating isolation, perfectionism, and honoring traditional methods of making. Empowering people to create things themselves and how to extend the life of our clothing rather than relying on an exploitative system.

Role: Communicating with communities and organizations working with textile waste. Prototype and making of weaving tools and experimentation second hand textiles.
