# Prototyping for Design

### Robots

Today we had an introduction to robotics and learned about robotic arms. The benefits of using a robotic arm versus other methods of manufacturing is the flexibility in multiple axises. Similar to a CNC, it has multiple end effectors however provides other opportunities such as antigravity printing. Through Grasshopper we saw how to create simulations and played around with scripts to see how the parameters could be controlled and modified. When creating a path to join points together it also can be made through determining the joing curve between the points, verses a linear path. This curve, or spline, should also be converted to have each point determined with the corrosponding plane. In the Grasshopper simulation file, I was able to download the plugins and libraries for robotics. I was able to run the script that draws a line in space. The images for running the scrips can be found below.
