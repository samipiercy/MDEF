# Prototyping for Design

### Robots

Today we had an introduction to robotics and learned about robotic arms. The benefits of using a robotic arm versus other methods of manufacturing is the flexibility in multiple axises. Similar to a CNC, it has multiple end effectors however provides other opportunities such as antigravity printing. Through Grasshopper we saw how to create simulations and played around with scripts to see how the parameters could be controlled and modified. When creating a path to join points together it also can be made through determining the joing curve between the points, verses a linear path. This curve, or spline, should also be converted to have each point determined with the corrosponding plane. In the Grasshopper simulation file, I was able to download the plugins and libraries for robotics. I was able to run the script that draws a line in space. The images for running the scrips can be found below.

### Blender

In this class we learned the origins of Blender, the community behind it, and the variety of applications that can be done using it. In picking a design tool, it is important to pick a tool that can you can learn from and be applied in multiple ways. For Blender it is used for animation, CAD, rendering, and can be connected to a multitude of devices and interfaces. There are a lot of tools that sell instant gratifaction of making something easy, and often times we donnot want to spend the time to learn a tool because it is not intuitive. However, this easyness that is offered is more about wanting a quick solution and to boost the user's ego. In the end, we know less and less about how things are working and because of this are limiting our overall potential of skills and making. 

### Interfaces

This course we learned about live coding and used a visualizing tool called Hydra to learn how we can  manipulate and create our own live visuals. We were able to edit existing visuals, write from scratch, use our own cameras and have the visuals be controlled by sound inputs. Coming from a non-coding background it was helpful to see how each command would change the visuals and parameters. It helped to understand the direct relationship and possibilities of what could be made using these tools.

### Blender + Interfaces

During this session we started using Blender and learned basic functions in moving models in space and created an array. We were able to to this using coding commands which showed the foundation of how Blender works. Unlike other CAD and rendering programs, Blender has a lot of ways to interact with it. We then saw how Arduino can be connected to Blender, using a switch modeled in Blender it could control a light on Arduino. In the images below it shows the demo of the Blender interface that would control the light switch. We had some difficulty in setting up the light on Arduino, however it was good to see another way that these tools could be used together and applied. Overall it made me interested in learning Blender.
