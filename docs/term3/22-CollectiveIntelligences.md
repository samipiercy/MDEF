# Collective Intelligences // Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

### Reflection

Seminar led by Mar Canet

In this class we learned about types of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), blockchains and learned how to set up NFTs. In talking about NFTs and AI generated art, it was an interesting discussion on what it means to actually own something. Also in thinking of the future of marketplaces and art, it was useful to understand the basics of these tools. I think many designers and artists are reluctant to use them and they feel like they will be replaced through these methods. However, understanding how to set them up and approach them gave insight on how they could be another tool for design and art ownership.

Before setting up our NFTs, we first created Temple wallets and used IPFS to set up our own local storage for digital assets. IPFS allows you to store locally and peer to peer, which makes it so your data is not stored on a cloud or someone else's server. We used a cryptocurrency called Tezos, which is an open-source blockchain currency. After making profiles we then set up our own NFT on objkt. For my NFT I created it on hugging face using the text to image AI generator.
