# About


Hello! I'm Sami, I am at MDEF to gain perspective from multiple disciplines and apply them in new methodologies towards current and future issues. My past experience is working as an Industrial Designer and I have developed products for multiple brands in the housewares industry. My interests are in finding sustainable and regenerative materials and bridging connections within communities through craft and resources.
