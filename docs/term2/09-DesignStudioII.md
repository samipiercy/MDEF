# Design Studio II

### Updated Design Space

![DesignSpace2](../images/2Term/1_DesignStudioII/DesignSpace2.jpg)

My updated design space focuses on three areas of interest: climate conscience, craftivism, and displacement of people. Within these three areas there are many weak signals that overlap and combine these areas. Climate conscience encompasses local material recirculation and circular economies. I am interested in looking at our waste in materials and food and how these precious resources can be recirculated back into society.

This relates to craftivism because of how this recirculation is done, who is doing it, and what is being made out of it. Through craftivism I am
interested in personal fabrication, cultural preservation, and non western-centric futures. Craftivism is about preservation and education about how things were made and giving credit to where these techniques come from in the world.

Lastly with displacement, I am interested in looking at resource distribution and service collaboration to bridge connections between local services providers. I would like to continue to build relationships with local organizations to learn more about what they are doing in Barcelona.
