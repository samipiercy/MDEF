# Remixing Materials

### Material Naratives

1. Material around me: tea bags

![TeaBags](../images/2Term/3_RemixingMaterials/TeaBags.JPG)

Properties: Nylon, paper, cotton string, resistant to heat, mesh properties, light weight, water resistant. Appears silky and “fancier,” emotions feel more elevated, the shape and material together make the item make you feel like it’s more than just a cup of tea. 

Description: Mesh bag containing tea leaves, heat sealed together and tied onto cotton string. This particular tea bag is in a pyramid shape, which is marketed to allow tea leaves to brew better by having more surface area in the bag to expand. 

Story: Tea bags were first claimed to be invented in 1904 in the US as a more convenient way to drink tea with easy cleanup and for single serving purposes. Material for nylon, PET, polypropylene, cotton or paper have been used. Many paper tea bags have a lining of polypropylene inside, making them non compostable.  Filter paper is made with thermoplastics in order to make it thermosealing and have strong fibers. 

Unfortunately having plastic in the tea bags makes it so your tea is filled with microplastics that are ingested with the tea, but also poured down drains and into landfills. 

Thermosealing paper for tea bags patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0380127A2/en

Applications:
- Nylon bags can be heat sealed together to be upcycled for reusable produce bags
- Upcycled thermosealing paper could be used as a textile for artificial plants or flowers

Properties:  Algae agar, cut into sequins for garments and textile, added onto linen-blended materials. The sequins are biodegradable, and able to have a variety of colors with added natural dyes. Gives an intriguing emotion with the natural but futuristic look of the material and variety of colors and textures.  

Description: The shape and layering of the sequins give depth and movement. The translucent effect gives the sequins a lot of depth, with the mix of textured to glossy shimmers. 

Story: Made by Carolyn Raff, who wanted to use materials from the ocean to show possibilities of what could be made from ocean-based materials. She wanted to make sustainable sequins made from a raw material. She used agar because it is readily available, can be manipulated easily, and can be mixed with other colors and materials. 

Applications:
- Algae bioplastic sheets could be used for cosmetic packaging
- Algae sequins could be used for home decor like lighting, curtains, decoration

3. Ideal material: Biodegradable silicone for kid products

![babymushie](../images/2Term/3_RemixingMaterials/babymushie.jpg)

Properties: Flexible, waterproof, easy to sterilize/antibacterial, heat resistant, bouncy and durable. Can be made in multiple colors and formed easily into shapes and molds, has similar emotional properties of feeling healthier while being easy to clean. 

Description: This material is approachable by kids and their parents, because it can be molded into flexible shapes with a variety of colors. 

Story: As babies and kids grow up the items around them do not need to last forever, since they are constantly evolving and needing different things. There is a lot of waste in toys and gear for kids, but also a lot of plastic that can be easily ingested. By having a biomaterial alternative it is healthier for the kids and the environment..

Applications:
- Sippy cups or tableware that is easy to clean and and flexible so they are harder to break
- Biodegradable toys, that can be composted when no longer needed or as the kid grows up
