# Prototyping for Design

## Week 1

### Reflection: Electronics & Coding

During this course we learned about how to approach making a proof of concept using electronic boards. In order to start prototyping, the board is dependent on the size and capacity needed to power the desired functions. It is important to review the datasheet of your microcontroller to make sure that it has the appropriate memory and power. 

The topic of open sourcing was discussed because Arduino is an example of opening up black boxes by making their technology available and shareable. This is through making the software easy to access by beginners, the use of community to contribute and share their knowledge, and the amount of general documentation across multiple languages and platforms for how to use this tool. Open sourcing requires you to also make your work open sourced if you modify the tool itself, however with permissive open source licenses you can use the tool without sharing your own. 

I have not had experience using Arduino or electronics in the past, so for the challenge to produce a song I needed to first understand how to attach the wires and pins to the board. I watched multiple videos and tried to follow diagrams of ESP32 with a buzzer. Once I understood how to follow the diagram and attach the pins it was more clear. 

I was able to follow the ESP32 Feather diagram to hook up the positive to the GND and negative to a designated pin. However, after placing the code for the pacman song into the Arduino, there were many errors and even though I changed the ports it still would not go through. I tested the board on a classmateâ€™s computer to see if it was the wiring on the board or the code and it was able to play their song easily. We played around with which port and board was selected, and eventually got the right combination. I modified the duration and pitch to see how the song would be manipulated. The videos below show the two changes.
