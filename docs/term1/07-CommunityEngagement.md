### Reflection

This week was very interesting for me because although I have taken a part and built products in industrial design, I am less familiar with electronics. Learning about AC vs. DC motors was new to me as well as working with Arduino. There was a steep learning curve to understand how we could control a motor using code. First was understanding how to make the motor run from a battery, and then learning how we could connect that power to Arduino for it to be controlled. Once we were able to map out how the electricity would flow it made a lot more sense and was a great way to visualize how energy flows from one element to another. It was also exciting to figure out how to make the motor turn different directions and brainstorm what else we could make it do. 

The topic of the right to repair is really interesting to me and from an industrial design perspective is something that gets pushed aside in the design process when it comes to cost of material and manufacturing. So many products are designed to work for a short period of time and do not give agency to the user when it comes to taking it a part and fixing it. Also with everything being encased in "black boxes" we are taught to make things look simple and seamless, when in fact that communicates to the user that they should not interfere with understanding how the product is working.
