# Design Studio: Framing Design Interventions

### Roles of Prototyping

*Which types of prototypes have you used and for what purposes?*

I have used the first and third types of prototypes the most –prototype as an experimental component and prototype as a research archetype. I have prototyped as an experimental component to test ergonomics and physical feasibility through frankenstein mock ups of a variety of materials such as 3d prints, wood, foam, metals, or scrap parts. These are to test the basic shape, scale, function, and look of an object for product design purposes. These prototypes were to test a hypothesis about if a concept was feasible, for example, if a specific shape of a container could preserve vegetables in the fridge 
longer. Or if a certain length or orientation of a handle made it easier or harder to be used. 

Prototype as a research archetype was used by creating prototypes that showed the possibility of a concept that was yet to exist. For example, mocking up 3D prints to appear like metal, plastic or fabric thicknesses and seeing how parts could be combined or mixed and matched. Or a medical boot 
concept from renderings and cardboard prototypes, which mocked up a new way of customizing your own medical boot using a moldable plastic. 


*Which ones haven’t you used and how do you think they could be interesting for you?*

The second or fourth types I have used the least –prototype as a means of inquiry and the process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. The second type will be interesting to create ways to collect types of data. Such as some type of technology or empathy probe that can create a reaction that is measured. By measuring an emotional connection, it can give a more holistic idea to how a hypothesis is being encountered. As well as showing how people are being transformed by an experience or object. The fourth type is interesting to see how the process itself can be analyzed by showing how something was created, by documenting the journey and research behind an artifact. 


*What are the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them and other design activities that you want to use?*

I would like to start with the third and fourth types of prototyping, to gather insight on my research direction and to document the process of inquiry. I would like to continue to use prototype four with the other three types to continue to document throughout different stages. I would use prototype two and one to test specific hypotheses and to ask and gather information through interviews and 
questionnaires.
