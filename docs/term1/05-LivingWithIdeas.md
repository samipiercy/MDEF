###   Reflection
What did you make? And why did it matter?
"How can I use natural elements to inform my food prep?" I spent the day buying, prepping, and cooking food in rudimentary ways. This mattered to look at ordinary tasks and see how they could be causing so much waste. With convenience and disassociation with our food and where it comes from, I wanted to create parameters to be forced to make decisions that were zero waste of packaging and electricity and use foods that had no waste to them as well.

What happens when you involve yourself?
By involving myself I had to give myself parameters which forced me to think creatively and confront my own habits and personal comforts. I also had my own expectations, that were confronted with what I could do in reality.

What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?
I used myself as a test by trying out this idea on myself, my routine and what I would be eating throughout the day. It highlights my own discomforts, feelings, and biases by using myself as an instrument for this process.

Did anything change about your way of working?
I had different expectations of buying the food and originally was focused more on going to different places to find bulk food. However after making the coffee and using the mortar & pestle I decided to incorporate it more as a tool and parameter for creativity. Later in the day I started to get more ideas for what to make and how I could use up all that I had bought to cook with. 

What does it mean for your future work?
In the future I will test an idea or parameters on myself first to see how I react and how they change my perspective on my hypothesis, to gain empathy, or have new insight on who I might involve next. Instead of over-thinking or planning out an idea too far out, I think itâ€™s important to test something even if the idea is not fully formed. 

After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?
There were a lot of videos surrounding waste as a topic from reusing wasted water, to understanding how much water it takes to make up the food and objects we own, waste in fashion to fulfill an impulse, and reducing what we really needed for the day. I think the topic of waste is a theme and it was inspiring to see how many ways it could be approached.
