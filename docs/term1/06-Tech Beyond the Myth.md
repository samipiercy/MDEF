###   Reflection
*What did you make? And why did it matter?*

"How can I use natural elements to inform my food prep?" I spent the day buying, prepping, and cooking food in rudimentary ways. This mattered to look at ordinary tasks and see how they could be causing so much waste. With convenience and disassociation with our food and where it comes from, I wanted to create parameters to be forced to make decisions that were zero waste of packaging and electricity and use foods that had no waste to them as well.

*What happens when you involve yourself?*
 making changes
