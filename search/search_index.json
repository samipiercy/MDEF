I have used the first and third types of prototypes the most \u2013prototype as an experimental component and prototype as a research archetype. I have prototyped as an experimental component to test ergonomics and physical feasibility through frankenstein mock ups of a variety of materials such as 3d prints, wood, foam, metals, or scrap parts. These are to test the basic shape, scale, function, and look of an object for product design purposes. These prototypes were to test a hypothesis about if a concept was feasible, for example, if a specific shape of a container could preserve vegetables in the fridge longer. Or if a certain length or orientation of a handle made it easier or harder to be used. Prototype as a research archetype was used by creating prototypes that showed the possibility of a concept that was yet to exist. For example, mocking up 3D prints to appear like metal, plastic or fabric thicknesses and seeing how parts could be combined or mixed and matched. Or a medical boot concept from renderings and cardboard prototypes, which mocked up a new way of customizing your own medical boot using a moldable plastic. Which ones haven\u2019t you used and how do you think they could be interesting for you? The second or fourth types I have used the least \u2013prototype as a means of inquiry and the process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. The second type will be interesting to create ways to collect types of data. Such as some type of technology or empathy probe that can create a reaction that is measured. By measuring an emotional connection, it can give a more holistic idea to how a hypothesis is being encountered. As well as showing how people are being transformed by an experience or object.

For Welfare State 2.0, I have the triggers: Wellness Tech, Food Apartheids, Nomadic Design, and Inclusivity Activism. My past experience has been working on projects related to unhoused peoples and seeing how resources can be accessible as well as finding ways to engage with people sleeping rough in cities. I also have some experience working with women and children from an indigenous group in Bolivia.

It suggests that as these viruses defrost, they could potentially infect surrounding wildlife causing the spread of infectious diseases or start another pandemic. The main scientific study the article references is a genetic analysis done for soil and lake sediments of Lake Hazen, which is a large Arctic freshwater lake. They talk about a process called \u201cviral spillover\u201d which is when a spectrum of viruses from a reservoir is then transmitted and infects a new host, which could then infect others. Due to climate change and warmer temperatures, they are trying to quantify the spillover potential. For this study they focused on soil and lake sediments. Using DNA and RNA sequencing they created an algorithm seeing how these viruses could potentially infect a range of hosts. They also estimated how much risk of spillover there is and how much the risk of spillover could increase from the runoff of glacier melt. This points to climate change as the cause of the spread of new viruses or pandemics. The research was done by scientists from the University of Ottawa and published in The Royal Society journal. The article also references examples of unknown viruses frozen in glaciers. An example of a virus infecting a nomadic group of people in arctic regions in northern Siberia, although the reference is from over six years ago. As well as, a finding from Ohio State University of an ice sample from the Tibetan plateau in China which had 28 novel viruses found, estimated to be 15,000 years old. Although the data collected shows potential risk of virus transmission due to climate change from spillover, it is still a simulation and has not happened yet. There is still a low chance of it being as dramatic as it seems. There are still many unknowns and the article is shedding light on how it is important to continue to study microorganisms all over the world as we are in a state of constant change due to climate change. The Arctic is warming up and there are many potential risks that can happen as it becomes thawed and microorganisms are no longer dormant.

In the Nature article \u201cEmergent biogeochemical risks from Arctic permafrost degradation,\u201d from 2021. This article talks about permafrost which is a permanently frozen layer underneath Earth\u2019s visible surface. They talk about a variety of potentially hazardous bacterias, chemicals, and viruses that have been dormant in the permafrost. In the diagram Fig.2, they show potential hazards of smallpox virus, Clostridium bacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria. It also shows nuclear waste and ancient DNA from dead animals. Clostridium bacteria is one of the leading causes for foodborne illnesses. This article talks about how there are methuselah microorganisms which have been able to stay around for millions of years. As the thawing continues, it increases activity of these dormant microorganisms which can cause change from the bottom up as the thawing is causing change from the top down, overall causing quicker changes within the permafrost and thawing layers. My findings from these two articles show a variety of potential risks and unknowns about the Arctic and what it holds. Typically when hearing about glacier melting we hear how it affects animals and habitats. However, understanding that there are century old microorganisms, viruses, and chemicals that we will have to face as the Arctic melts, is something that should be shared more as a dangerous consequence of climate change.

We started with a forensic report of a broken item, and followed with creating an Almost Useful Machine. Below are presentations of each project followed by my reflection. Forensic Report \u00b6 We began the first week choosing an item that had stopped working to disassemble. Our item was a Sports Blender by Electrolux, which was surprisingly difficult to take a part. While disassembling the casing, we came across a single screw (spanner slotted) which is typically used to prevent tampering. This tiny screw made it impossible to take a part the casing, and it resulted in us using a drill and saw to break the base open. We also learned that this particular blender failed because there was a nut bolt piece that had misaligned due to overheating of the PP material encasing it. Although the item was filled with metal and copper parts, this one area of plastic made the item fail. This material choice may be because they intended the blender to be used less frequent because it was designed for a single serving. Older and more robust blenders have the intention of serving larger quantities, so glass or harder materials are used. This item seemed to be targetting individuals who wanted a cheaper and quick solution to make protein shakes or smoothies, but in the end the item was designed to be short lived and unable to be repaired. Our Foresnic Report can be found here: Forensic Report Distracted Timer - Almost Useful Machine \u00b6 After learning about motors from our broken blender, we used a windshield wiper motor to create a distracted timer. Using Arduino and sensors, we were able to make our almost useful machine. Initially we were playing around with how to make the motor turn different dirrections and how we could make it feel random. We coded the amount of time it would turn a direction and also played with a manual switch which would reverse the energy, and make the motor reverse. We followed with brainstorming concepts and ideas that were interesting to us as a group and landed on making something that would be annoying to us.

Presentation Video Motor hooked up to Arduino Cardboard mockup Reflection \u00b6 This week was very interesting for me because although I have taken a part and built products in industrial design, I am less familiar with electronics. Learning about AC vs. DC motors was new to me as well as working with Arduino. There was a steep learning curve to understand how we could control a motor using code. First was understanding how to make the motor run from a battery, and then learning how we could connect that power to Arduino for it to be controlled. Once we were able to map out how the electricity would flow it made a lot more sense and was a great way to visualize how energy flows from one element to another. It was also exciting to figure out how to make the motor turn different directions and brainstorm what else we could make it do. The topic of the right to repair is really interesting to me and from an industrial design perspective is something that gets pushed aside in the design process when it comes to cost of material and manufacturing.

Our item was a Sports Blender by Electrolux, which was surprisingly difficult to take a part. While disassembling the casing, we came across a single screw (spanner slotted) which is typically used to prevent tampering. This tiny screw made it impossible to take a part the casing, and it resulted in us using a drill and saw to break the base open. We also learned that this particular blender failed because there was a nut bolt piece that had misaligned due to overheating of the PP material encasing it. Although the item was filled with metal and copper parts, this one area of plastic made the item fail. This material choice may be because they intended the blender to be used less frequent because it was designed for a single serving. Older and more robust blenders have the intention of serving larger quantities, so glass or harder materials are used. This item seemed to be targetting individuals who wanted a cheaper and quick solution to make protein shakes or smoothies, but in the end the item was designed to be short lived and unable to be repaired.
