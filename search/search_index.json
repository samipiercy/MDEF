I have used the first and third types of prototypes the most \u2013prototype as an experimental component and prototype as a research archetype. I have prototyped as an experimental component to test ergonomics and physical feasibility through frankenstein mock ups of a variety of materials such as 3d prints, wood, foam, metals, or scrap parts. These are to test the basic shape, scale, function, and look of an object for product design purposes. These prototypes were to test a hypothesis about if a concept was feasible, for example, if a specific shape of a container could preserve vegetables in the fridge longer. Or if a certain length or orientation of a handle made it easier or harder to be used. Prototype as a research archetype was used by creating prototypes that showed the possibility of a concept that was yet to exist. For example, mocking up 3D prints to appear like metal, plastic or fabric thicknesses and seeing how parts could be combined or mixed and matched. Or a medical boot concept from renderings and cardboard prototypes, which mocked up a new way of customizing your own medical boot using a moldable plastic. Which ones haven\u2019t you used and how do you think they could be interesting for you? The second or fourth types I have used the least \u2013prototype as a means of inquiry and the process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. The second type will be interesting to create ways to collect types of data. Such as some type of technology or empathy probe that can create a reaction that is measured. By measuring an emotional connection, it can give a more holistic idea to how a hypothesis is being encountered. As well as showing how people are being transformed by an experience or object. The fourth type is interesting to see how the process itself can be analyzed by showing how something was created, by documenting the journey and research behind an artifact. What are the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them and other design activities that you want to use? I would like to start with the third and fourth types of prototyping, to gather insight on my research direction and to document the process of inquiry. I would like to continue to use prototype four with the other three types to continue to document throughout different stages. I would use prototype two and one to test specific hypotheses and to ask and gather information through interviews and questionnaires. Personal Workspace \u00b6 Communication Strategy \u00b6 Below are the communication strategies I am planning for: Open Design Processes: Understand your audience: As a first step, I am looking to continue interviewing people that may relate to my interests and project, through faculty and MDEF connections. I want to understand what is currently happening in Barcelona, past projects, and learn from people working in similar fields. I am also engaging in local events that relate to waste and volunteering with current groups providing services for underserved communities. Experiential prototypes & compiling material samples: As part of my process I will start to experiment with materials and resources that I find interesting and take photos and videos of my process. Currently I am interested in craft and sustainable materials. There is a lot of biomaterial research that I am open to exploring, as it is a new area of interest for me. I am also interested in textiles and will start my own personal textile project to get into a creative mindset that is not pressured by school or income, but could spark future ideas. Communication Medium: Graphics or drawings to understand the process and concept: I plan to map my interests and connections as they continue to evolve. I will physically draw out these maps to have a visual representation of my thought process. Social media presence to document and show process and journey: I will use social media as a way to document and share my MDEF journey. I would like to eventually build an identity that is accessible to past colleagues and designers as a way to engage with current industry, but that also shows my work and development. Collective Design Intervention \u00b6 As the Hack the Supply Chain group we made our first intervention by cooking a dinner together using collected food waste scraps. This started because we were curious about why we value parts of a vegetable or fruit as \u201cwaste\u201d and wondered what we could create out of this so-called \u201cwaste.\u201d For a week we each saved up our peels, stale bread, wilting fruits and vegetables. We each picked a recipe to make and cooked them simultaneously. By cooking together we were able to improvise, and collaborate on the recipes together. Some dishes followed an exact recipe, while others changed depending on what ingredients we had and the motivation to use as much of it as possible. We were all surprised at how much food we ended up making and that we were able to use almost everything we brought. We were also surprised with how good everything looked and tasted. This first intervention was a good way to start testing out a question. Even though we weren\u2019t all interested in food specifically, it was something universal that could be related to by everyone. It helped to bring up other questions that relate to supply chains and society\u2019s conditioning. Such as, how we were taught about what to throw away and what to keep, what expiration dates really mean, and how packaging could be improved. Here are images from before, and after cooking:","title":"Design Studio I"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio/#design-studio-framing-design-interventions","text":"","title":"Design Studio: Framing Design Interventions"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio/#roles-of-prototyping","text":"Which types of prototypes have you used and for what purposes?

To me Welfare State 2.0 means the general well being of citizens and what the future looks like for people on the margins of society. What does it look like for equality of all peoples, genders, ages, races. I chose the second card, Climate Conscience, because I also want to relate to sustainability of the planet and how we use resources, materials, and live among nature. My design space is currently a brainstorm with general ideas at the top filtering to more specific ideas below. For Welfare State 2.0, I have the triggers: Wellness Tech, Food Apartheids, Nomadic Design, and Inclusivity Activism. My past experience has been working on projects related to unhoused peoples and seeing how resources can be accessible as well as finding ways to engage with people sleeping rough in cities. I also have some experience working with women and children from an indigenous group in Bolivia. I have other interests in prevention of food waste and have done many projects related to cooking and food prep. When living in Cleveland there were many food desserts that came along with gentrification and the segregation of societies. There are so many specific issues to address, but for now I would like to broaden my scope to looking at nomadic lifestyles and wellness. Although my background is in product design, I would like to explore alternative ways of designing a thoughtful way of improving some aspect of someone\u2019s well being as relating to basic necessities. In terms of who, I am interested in working with women and children who are often overlooked. Within my second area of Climate Conscience I have the trigger cards: Craftivism and Local Materials Recirculation. My past experience is working a lot with manufacturing of plastics and metals. I have seen the unsustainable processes that go into making a product from start to finish and have a lot of knowledge about manufacturing. Using my knowledge of production cycles, I can see how new materials or alternative methods could be applied to have a sustainable outcome. I am interested in textiles and making things by hand in a way that teaches new skills. I have experience with weaving and sewing, and would like to learn other types of textile making. I think craftivism is a great gateway to looking at non-western centric futures, as each culture has its own techniques and practices.

Article \u00b6 The article I chose is from The Guardian, Geddes (2022), \u201cNext pandemic may come from melting glaciers, new data shows.\u201d In summary it is about how melting glaciers are exposing ancient viruses. It suggests that as these viruses defrost, they could potentially infect surrounding wildlife causing the spread of infectious diseases or start another pandemic. The main scientific study the article references is a genetic analysis done for soil and lake sediments of Lake Hazen, which is a large Arctic freshwater lake. They talk about a process called \u201cviral spillover\u201d which is when a spectrum of viruses from a reservoir is then transmitted and infects a new host, which could then infect others. Due to climate change and warmer temperatures, they are trying to quantify the spillover potential. For this study they focused on soil and lake sediments. Using DNA and RNA sequencing they created an algorithm seeing how these viruses could potentially infect a range of hosts. They also estimated how much risk of spillover there is and how much the risk of spillover could increase from the runoff of glacier melt. This points to climate change as the cause of the spread of new viruses or pandemics. The research was done by scientists from the University of Ottawa and published in The Royal Society journal. The article also references examples of unknown viruses frozen in glaciers. An example of a virus infecting a nomadic group of people in arctic regions in northern Siberia, although the reference is from over six years ago. As well as, a finding from Ohio State University of an ice sample from the Tibetan plateau in China which had 28 novel viruses found, estimated to be 15,000 years old. Although the data collected shows potential risk of virus transmission due to climate change from spillover, it is still a simulation and has not happened yet. There is still a low chance of it being as dramatic as it seems. There are still many unknowns and the article is shedding light on how it is important to continue to study microorganisms all over the world as we are in a state of constant change due to climate change. The Arctic is warming up and there are many potential risks that can happen as it becomes thawed and microorganisms are no longer dormant. I looked into an article from Nature, which talks about the Arctic melting to see if there are any similar findings that could back up the article from The Guardian. In the Nature article \u201cEmergent biogeochemical risks from Arctic permafrost degradation,\u201d from 2021. This article talks about permafrost which is a permanently frozen layer underneath Earth\u2019s visible surface. They talk about a variety of potentially hazardous bacterias, chemicals, and viruses that have been dormant in the permafrost. In the diagram Fig.2, they show potential hazards of smallpox virus, Clostridium bacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria. It also shows nuclear waste and ancient DNA from dead animals. Clostridium bacteria is one of the leading causes for foodborne illnesses. This article talks about how there are methuselah microorganisms which have been able to stay around for millions of years. As the thawing continues, it increases activity of these dormant microorganisms which can cause change from the bottom up as the thawing is causing change from the top down, overall causing quicker changes within the permafrost and thawing layers. My findings from these two articles show a variety of potential risks and unknowns about the Arctic and what it holds. Typically when hearing about glacier melting we hear how it affects animals and habitats. However, understanding that there are century old microorganisms, viruses, and chemicals that we will have to face as the Arctic melts, is something that should be shared more as a dangerous consequence of climate change.

And why did it matter? \u201cHow can I use natural elements to inform my food prep?\u201d I spent the day buying, prepping, and cooking food in rudimentary ways. This mattered to look at ordinary tasks and see how they could be causing so much waste. With convenience and disassociation with our food and where it comes from, I wanted to create parameters to be forced to make decisions that were zero waste of packaging and electricity and use foods that had no waste to them as well. What happens when you involve yourself? By involving myself I had to give myself parameters which forced me to think creatively and confront my own habits and personal comforts. I also had my own expectations, that were confronted with what I could do in reality. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I used myself as a test by trying out this idea on myself, my routine and what I would be eating throughout the day. It highlights my own discomforts, feelings, and biases by using myself as an instrument for this process. Did anything change about your way of working? I had different expectations of buying the food and originally was focused more on going to different places to find bulk food. However after making the coffee and using the mortar & pestle I decided to incorporate it more as a tool and parameter for creativity. Later in the day I started to get more ideas for what to make and how I could use up all that I had bought to cook with. What does it mean for your future work? In the future I will test an idea or parameters on myself first to see how I react and how they change my perspective on my hypothesis, to gain empathy, or have new insight on who I might involve next. Instead of over-thinking or planning out an idea too far out, I think it\u2019s important to test something even if the idea is not fully formed. After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? There were a lot of videos surrounding waste as a topic from reusing wasted water, to understanding how much water it takes to make up the food and objects we own, waste in fashion to fulfill an impulse, and reducing what we really needed for the day. I think the topic of waste is a theme and it was inspiring to see how many ways it could be approached.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living With Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#1-min-video","text":"","title":"1 min video"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#reflection","text":"What did you make? And why did it matter? \u201cHow can I use natural elements to inform my food prep?\u201d I spent the day buying, prepping, and cooking food in rudimentary ways. This mattered to look at ordinary tasks and see how they could be causing so much waste. With convenience and disassociation with our food and where it comes from, I wanted to create parameters to be forced to make decisions that were zero waste of packaging and electricity and use foods that had no waste to them as well. What happens when you involve yourself? By involving myself I had to give myself parameters which forced me to think creatively and confront my own habits and personal comforts. I also had my own expectations, that were confronted with what I could do in reality. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I used myself as a test by trying out this idea on myself, my routine and what I would be eating throughout the day. It highlights my own discomforts, feelings, and biases by using myself as an instrument for this process. Did anything change about your way of working? I had different expectations of buying the food and originally was focused more on going to different places to find bulk food. However after making the coffee and using the mortar & pestle I decided to incorporate it more as a tool and parameter for creativity. Later in the day I started to get more ideas for what to make and how I could use up all that I had bought to cook with. What does it mean for your future work? In the future I will test an idea or parameters on myself first to see how I react and how they change my perspective on my hypothesis, to gain empathy, or have new insight on who I might involve next. Instead of over-thinking or planning out an idea too far out, I think it\u2019s important to test something even if the idea is not fully formed.

We started with a forensic report of a broken item, and followed with creating an Almost Useful Machine. Below are presentations of each project followed by my reflection. Forensic Report \u00b6 We began the first week choosing an item that had stopped working to disassemble. Our item was a Sports Blender by Electrolux, which was surprisingly difficult to take a part. While disassembling the casing, we came across a single screw (spanner slotted) which is typically used to prevent tampering. This tiny screw made it impossible to take a part the casing, and it resulted in us using a drill and saw to break the base open. We also learned that this particular blender failed because there was a nut bolt piece that had misaligned due to overheating of the PP material encasing it. Although the item was filled with metal and copper parts, this one area of plastic made the item fail. This material choice may be because they intended the blender to be used less frequent because it was designed for a single serving. Older and more robust blenders have the intention of serving larger quantities, so glass or harder materials are used. This item seemed to be targetting individuals who wanted a cheaper and quick solution to make protein shakes or smoothies, but in the end the item was designed to be short lived and unable to be repaired. Our Foresnic Report can be found here: Forensic Report Distracted Timer - Almost Useful Machine \u00b6 After learning about motors from our broken blender, we used a windshield wiper motor to create a distracted timer. Using Arduino and sensors, we were able to make our almost useful machine. Initially we were playing around with how to make the motor turn different dirrections and how we could make it feel random. We coded the amount of time it would turn a direction and also played with a manual switch which would reverse the energy, and make the motor reverse. We followed with brainstorming concepts and ideas that were interesting to us as a group and landed on making something that would be annoying to us. The initial timer was able to change directions based on the code, however we added the sensor element to create more of a random and personification of the timer itself. The presentation can be found here: Presentation Video Motor hooked up to Arduino Cardboard mockup Reflection \u00b6 This week was very interesting for me because although I have taken a part and built products in industrial design, I am less familiar with electronics. Learning about AC vs. DC motors was new to me as well as working with Arduino. There was a steep learning curve to understand how we could control a motor using code. First was understanding how to make the motor run from a battery, and then learning how we could connect that power to Arduino for it to be controlled. Once we were able to map out how the electricity would flow it made a lot more sense and was a great way to visualize how energy flows from one element to another. It was also exciting to figure out how to make the motor turn different directions and brainstorm what else we could make it do. The topic of the right to repair is really interesting to me and from an industrial design perspective is something that gets pushed aside in the design process when it comes to cost of material and manufacturing. So many products are designed to work for a short period of time and do not give agency to the user when it comes to taking it a part and fixing it. Also with everything being encased in \u201cblack boxes\u201d we are taught to make things look simple and seamless, when in fact that communicates to the user that they should not interfere with understanding how the product is working.","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"This seminar we learned about the right to repair, black boxes, how things are made, and how we can combine code with machines.

It was helpful to think about how to practically work with stakeholders that have their own motivations and maneuver between a variety of perspectives and needs within a community project. We did a hypothetical role playing of stake holders that would work with a local building and residency. Acting out how each role would interact with each other, and understanding each role\u2019s needs and motivations. I enjoyed visiting local places in Poblenou that have created open spaces for artists and the surrounding neighborhood to collaborate. Two of the places we visited were working with food waste and biomaterials to make products, education, and designs. Poblenou has an interesting dynamic with the gentrification of tech, it was good to see artist spaces and organizations that are working to keep historical buildlings preserved and think about what role artists play in that preservation. Intervention Outline Community Framework \u00b6 Exercise on engaging with local community: Creative community: I am interested in working with local communities who work with people that have been marginalized or have difficulty meeting their basic needs. Context: Each city has their own social dynamics that contribute to the wellbeing of specific communities. Whether it is by race, gender, or socio-economic status, there is an imbalance of opportunity and services for specific groups of people. Coming from Seattle where there is an increasing gap of rich vs. poor, gentrification, and a growing population of people experiencing homelessness, I am curious to know in Barcelona what the dynamics and situations are here. Current situation: From my current and limited understanding, there is a large population of migrant workers and refugees. There are marginalized groups of people based on their race, socio-economic status, and legal documentation. There are people living on the street but also services addressing food and shelter in their own ways. It seems that there is community involvement in many areas, but the communication between services is still limited as each group is addressing issues in their own way. Engagement & Limits: Takes time to engage and understand the current situation and organizations. I am an outsider and come with my own biases, understandings, and interpretations. I understand that I will make my own judgements before fully understanding the whole situation, and need to be aware of those. Theory of change: Connecting services to one another and drawing bridges between different organizations could help to make sure there are no gaps of people being reached out to or addressed. It also could help to create ways of collaboration between multiple organizations. Design challenges & opportunities: The main challenge is to first engage and observe, because there may be a desire for design but it is more important to understand these situations before jumping to any action.

Term 2 design space update: An updated design space as I enter into Term 2. Connections and topics I want to further explore in term 2. My design space shows three areas of interest: climate conscience, craftivism, and displacement of people. At the end of Term 1 my project was able to develop through working with others to create multiple interventions and explorations. The main focus was around waste, and specifically food waste. We approached this through collecting our own waste, questioning our relationship to it, and experimenting with what we could make out of it. After learning basic bioplastic and paper recipes, I learned the complexity of making a sustainable material. Food waste was accessible and relatable. We learned not only about biomaterials but it also made us rethink our eating habits and new food recipes. During design dialogues, I was able to talk with people about their interest in learning how to make their own materials from their waste and how they could cook recipes that would eliminate food waste. We also worked with local social organizations, Food Not Bombs and Esperanca. Both organizations use food as a way to connect. Food Not Bombs collects local grocery waste and turns it into community public dinners. Esperanca collaborates with people to share their cooking skills and serves food to people on the street on the weekends, a time where services are closed. I started the term motivated by my fight of finding new ways to approach the systemic and growing issue of displaced peoples, specifically people sleeping rough. With the complexity of this topic I felt like it was difficult to engage and understand the systems in Barcelona with the short amount of time. I was grateful to be able to connect briefly with the two organizations, and in Term 2 would like to find ways to connect organizations to each other and be a bridge between resources and services. I would like to find ways to have more open dialogue about my project so it can feel more connected to their context and have time to learn from their expertise. The rate in which waste is produced seems impossible to keep up with in how it can be addressed. I am interested in looking at both approaches to waste management. One being how we can use our current waste and give it a second life. From ocean plastics in the great pacific garbage patch, to garbage islands, there is an abundance of used material all around. The second approach is looking at alternatives to replace plastic and wasteful materials. This would include biodegradable and circular economy approaches. There is a ripple effect that could come out of addressing one material issue. This is through seeing the bigger picture of the supply chain, the employees and community affected, and the culture that surrounds that material. My approach this term is to continue exploring materials while questioning the context and meaning behind them. I will volunteer with organizations to gain perspective and see possible connections between them. I am collaborating with others to create bio-design themed dinners using material and food as dialogue about the future and current state of our environment. Autoethnography: 1PP Reflection \u00b6 24 hour packaging waste collection Defined study boundaries. Can I understand the object of my study? Was it open? Did I change it? Can I define the boundaries of my study? This experiment was planned for a limit of 24 hours. The purpose was to become aware of what packaging waste I produce, and was open to any type of packaging. I stuck to it for the day because it was clear enough for me to execute and collect all the items to be photographed the next day. Authenticity. Was my first person perspective authentic? Was it meaningful? For the specific day it was authentic, however because it was only for 24 hours it did not show an accurate average of the type of waste I might produce. This is because the amount could vary based on my activities during the day. However, for the purpose of 1PP the experiment was decided quickly without thinking much about where I would be going or what I would be eating or buying for that day. Scholarship or plausibility. Is this useful? Can it be written and explained? The task of this experiment was clear enough that it could be executed over a longer period of time and would be helpful to also see decisions that led to the waste I produced. It was useful to bring awareness of my decisions and actions that contribute to producing trash. Next time I would want to show decisions that led me to buying or throwing out a particular item. Criticality. Did my actions make me learn about other things? My actions during this experiment made me aware that the majority of packaging waste I produce comes from food. It also showed me how much plastic is involved and how unclear each container is on how to discard it. Self-revealing communication. Did I show everything of my work? Was there something I didn\u2019t show for some reason? The photo documents the end result of collecting for one day, however it could be helpful to see the amount collected over a week to show a larger impact. Also it could help to show where I was buying these items and their context. Ethnographic material with confessional content. How much of what I have done relevant? This is relevant to my project because we are looking at how we can intervene in the supply chain to produce sustainable alternatives to packaging. It is relevant to show what it is like living in a state of convenience, small living quarters in a city, and on a smaller budget from being a student. All these factors contribute to the decisions and habits where waste is produced quickly. Generalisability. Can it be meaningful to others? What kind of profile is the one which I am looking at? It could be meaningful to others to bring more awareness of the amount of plastic and waste that they are consuming and throwing out. It also is meaningful to have people think about how convenience is driving so much of our choices and has an impact on the environment.

It also is meaningful to have people think about how convenience is driving so much of our choices and has an impact on the environment.","title":"Autoethnography: 1PP Reflection"},{"location":"term2/09-DesignStudioII/#alternative-presents","text":"Intervention: Playa x Plastic Intervention: Future Cravings Dinner Intervention: Crafting Community","title":"Alternative Presents:"},{"location":"term2/10-BillionSeconds/","text":"Design for the Next Billion Seconds \u00b6 Reflection \u00b6 In the seminar Design for the Next Billion Seconds, we questioned what futures we wanted to remember one billion seconds from now.

We collected discarded flowers and plants from local shops in Eixample and Poblenou. Some reasons for flowers to be discarded are because of they are too short for arrangements or they have some imperfections. Floral waste is also prevalent in weddings, cemeteries, and temple use.

In order to start prototyping, the board is dependent on the size and capacity needed to power the desired functions. It is important to review the datasheet of your microcontroller to make sure that it has the appropriate memory and power. The topic of open sourcing was discussed because Arduino is an example of opening up black boxes by making their technology available and shareable. This is through making the software easy to access by beginners, the use of community to contribute and share their knowledge, and the amount of general documentation across multiple languages and platforms for how to use this tool. Open sourcing requires you to also make your work open sourced if you modify the tool itself, however with permissive open source licenses you can use the tool without sharing your own. I have not had experience using Arduino or electronics in the past, so for the challenge to produce a song I needed to first understand how to attach the wires and pins to the board. I watched multiple videos and tried to follow diagrams of ESP32 with a buzzer. Once I understood how to follow the diagram and attach the pins it was more clear. I was able to follow the ESP32 Feather diagram to hook up the positive to the GND and negative to a designated pin. However, after placing the code for the pacman song into the Arduino, there were many errors and even though I changed the ports it still would not go through. I tested the board on a classmate\u2019s computer to see if it was the wiring on the board or the code and it was able to play their song easily. We played around with which port and board was selected, and eventually got the right combination. I modified the duration and pitch to see how the song would be manipulated. The videos below show the two changes. Some resources I used: https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-piezo-buzzer https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-use-active-and-passive-buzzers-on-the-arduino/ https://www.robotique.tech/robotics/control-a-buzzer-by-the-esp32-card/ 2D, 3D Parametric Design Tools \u00b6 Today we learned about the basics of parametric design with 2D and 3D software. The difference between CPU versus GPU and how they relate to the types of image processing needed to run certain programs. CPU allows for heavier mathematical equations and GPU can calculate many small equations. This relates to how vectors and pixels process information as well. Vector can scale without losing definition and is CPU processed, while Pixels are located on a x, y, z grid are GPU processed. Similarly to vectors and pixels, there are mesh versus nurbs, which are also distinguished by the type of processing. Mesh is defined by points and uses polygons, it is mostly used for STL 3D printing files, but is not good for scaling like pixels. Nurbs is used in surface modeling because it allows you to modify smooth and fluid shapes. I have a lot of experience in 3D modeling with Solidworks and using Keyshot as a rendering software. I wanted to spend the day learning Rhino because it uses Nurbs and is good for modeling organic shapes. I mainly used Solidworks for surface modeling as well, but it is more difficult to make organic shapes. After using it for the day I realized that Rhino is easy to model quickly, however it is difficult to change past decisions because of the feature tree. There was a plate design with water ripples on it that I was trying to replicate. I worked with Paige to think about the shape we wanted to create, because it is something we found for inspiration for our Bio Deisgn Dinner group who is focusing on making tableware that has water elements. At first I drew the outlines of the ripples, but then found the pipe tool that allowed me to build off of some organic lines. I then added some fillets around the edges after combining the separate pieces. Through this exercise I was able to learn about scaling, fillets, manipulating lines and combining solid geometry. I would like to make another version that can be made into a mold that we can use to fill with biomaterial. Explorations: Week 2 \u00b6 2D Fabrication (Laser, Vinyl) \u00b6 Today we learned about Laser and vinyl cutters and the components that make up these machines. A laser cutter is categorized as a CNC machine because it also uses a 3+ axis, and it uses subtractive methods to engrave, mark and cut. We learned about a variety of applications that can be used such as creating living hinges, molds, laminating, and soldering. I am interested in seeing how we can laser cut biomaterials and solder them in order to eliminate glues and stitching. We received a demo for using a vinyl cutter, where we saw an application of it for copper foil to create circuit shapes. Also it can be used as a drawing tool by swapping out the blade for a pen to create computer aided drawings. The cut vinyl can also be used as a simple screen print or masking. I decided to make a 2D mold in acrylic for molding biomaterials. Since most biomaterials need non-stick surfaces, I chose this material and a 5mm thickness so that there could be enough height for the mold. The outlined shape will be able to be filled as a mold, and the subtracted negative space can be used as a stencil or stamp. I created the file in Illustrator and for the machine we use Rhino for printing and preparing the file. There was some trouble shooting needed to be able to cut through the material thickness, it needed multiple passes because it was 5mm. Also in order to read the file, the program was having a difficult time reading the lines to cut. Overall we were able to cut successfully and gain more confidence in using Rhino, printing software, and the laser cutter. Inputs & Outputs \u00b6 During this course we learned about inputs and outputs, and how we can use them to sense an environment. Depending on how we change the inputs, it can produce different outputs. For closed loop systems, the device can regulate its output and make decisions based on the new inputs around it without interference. We also learned about sensors and how they are being used in all our devices to collect data. Even if the sensor itself is cheap, the data that it is collecting holds the value. The companies now that own those data sets have the most power. An example of data collection through sensors is biometric data. This can be through collecting our heart rates and how our body might be reacting in certain environments. And also our biometric fingerprint, where they can detect our own personal movements of how your body and hands interact with a device through movement and gestures. Our phones are collecting so much personal data and we are also freely giving access because they are addicting to use. This week instagram asked me to give access to all my photos and videos, and when I chose not to, it was very difficult to use the app without giving consent. When looking closer at what they want, it is for access to your microphone, camera, location and \u201cdepth\u201d information. Even if you have control over what photos are being posted to the public, they have control over all your photos and are now part of their collective dataset. As well as any new data from the sensors on your phone. For the exercise, I worked mostly on the LDR light sensor to be able to detect the amount of light in the room. I was able to modify the code to have less parameters so that the sensor would be mainly detecting dark or light, versus a spectrum of light. There was some difficulty getting the sensor to detect quickly. Since our ESP32 board is 3v and the Arduino is 5v, I tried using different ohm amounts for the resistor to see if it would read better. Below in the videos you can see that the sensor was detecting all the small variables from dim to very bright. We worked together to make another board have a switch to turn on and off the LED. We had difficulty running the code on each computer, so were unable to have them talk to each other. However they were able to work separately for the most part. Some links I used: https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-light-sensor?utm_content=cmp-true https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-light-sensor Week 3 \u00b6 Micro Challenge I \u00b6 The documentation of our process can be found here: https://github.com/PaigePerill/gotaplatemold- Project Explanation: For the micro challenge this week, our team worked together to create a biopress mold that could be used to produce a set of biomaterial plates quickly. These plates are to be used for our intervention of an ocean-themed dinner where the tableware and food courses are made of the same ingredients with a special focus on food waste and regenerative resources. We went through multiple rounds of iterations to figure out what type of mold and plate shapes we wanted to create. Originally we wanted to make a press that could have interchangeable parts to reduce the material impact that molds can create. Our objective was also to create a design that could be easily replicable by others, using just a laser cutter and screws. In order to create a successful 3D shape, we needed to iterate quickly to understand how we could use 2D prototyping to make a 3D object. We did this by iterating with cardboard and wood prototypes before cutting in acrylic. We wanted to make the most out of one mold, so we updated the design from one shape to three shapes that could be modular within themselves. We also did some material tests with calcium carbonate to see how it would stick to acrylic. We tested with parchment paper, cornstarch, and vaseline. To make the design as smooth as possible without wrinkles, we were able to use vaseline and cornstarch as a mold release. We also wanted to incorporate technology into our mold by using a humidity and temperature sensor. Since the material would be taken out of the mold before drying, we could use the sensor to regulate the environment that the materials are in. Eventually we would like to measure the humidity of the material itself. We were able to get the sensor to read the air humidity, but are still having difficulty connecting it to an LCD screen. We tried multiple screens, but need more power in order to have the contrast show up on the screen itself. Learnings: Some key learnings were that the press needed a significant amount of pressure to extract the excess material. Especially because calcium carbonate is a thick material with high viscosity. The screws we used were great to key the mold together, but we needed to use extra clamps to get the excess material out of the mold. A positive was that we were able to take the plates of the mold after forming the shape while the material was still wet. This allows the possibility to produce a lot in a short time, versus 3d printing one plate at a time over a longer period of time. However the downside is the amount of material needed to make one mold. I would still like to find a way to make a mold with minimal plastics and materials that can be reused and reformed into new shapes.. If we can make molds from plaster or ceramics that would be an option for reusable mold materials.

We looked at the pros and cons between materials and types of 3D printing applications. One main takeaway was the infill being a big factor of weight, movement, and strength. The infill amount can be less as long as the bottom and top layers have an appropriate thickness. The object properties can be changed by the infill pattern, depending on how isotropic the pattern is. There should also be a balance between how fast the print is versus the amount of layers. As thinner layers can print faster, however with thicker layers you need less layers. For 3D scanning, meshes are created by calculating points in space. The high number of points, the higher the resolution is. The object I scanned was a crochet sphere I made using amigurumi, a Japanese technique for making 3D knit shapes. I wanted to see how different phone 3D scanners would be able to pick up the texture from the textile and organic shape. I tried multiple scanning apps such as Polycam, Captur3, and WIDAR. I tried with photos and LIDAR, however the auto mode of photo scanning was the most successful. Polycam had the most clear 3D mesh, however I used the mesh from Captur3 because it is a free program for downloading mesh, in this case an .obj file. Next time I would like to capture it with better lighting and less shadows. Despite me using my phone and not a tripod, the software was still able to capture the object well. After, I imported the .obj file into Rhino and edited it to make it watertight. I was able to print it in PLA and at first the material was not sticking well to the print bed. So we updated the settings to be from low to standard and increased the temperature to 215 degrees. Next, I would like to scan a piece that has more holes and bigger textures to see how it can capture them in the 3D scan and print. Networking \u00b6 In this course we learned about what a network is, how they have been designed today and then created our own local network within our class. A network is when data is copied from one place to another, similar to a copy machine. The way they have been designed today has made it so there are multiple copies that are being sent all over the world, as most data is sent to California. Networks are helpful in doing multiple tasks at the same time and to send information quickly. However, when it comes to sending information locally, we are still sending it across multiple oceans or cities because it is how we have designed networks to be. If there were local networks for simple tasks, it would make more sense to have a collection of small networks. In the end the power goes to the companies that have the largest datasets and control over them. Even though these large companies are collecting this data, it does not mean it is necessarily diverse. For our exercise, we first connected our ESP32 feather boards to the local wifi network where we could see our own messages being sent. We then connected to Victor\u2019s IP address as our local server, where we could receive his message. After each of us connected individually to our local server, we could then be assigned to each other and were able to send messages to one another. This exercise helped illustrate the complexity between sending and receiving messages but also how on a small scale you are able to point to where your information is being stored directly. You have ownership over your own information and can choose to keep or delete it. There is a need to have everything stored on a cloud, a fear of losing your information even though most of it is forgotten about by us. Every year we are storing more and creating more information than ever before. Local networks are a good way to keep track of your own data, filter and keep only what is necessary. The images below show the three stages of our exercise from connecting to the network, local server, and talking to each other locally. Week 5 \u00b6 Interfaces \u00b6 This week we had a hands-on approach to understanding networking and interfaces through using LEDs with Arduino. We learned about a variety of ways to control LEDs through Arduino and the internet and slowly built complexity from directly controlling the LED to controlling it through the internet. Using the jled library, we could add different animations to the lights such as blinking, breathing, or burning like a candle. This library uses non-blocking which ensures that there is always a connection between the input and output. We first used blink code from Arduino to tell our LED to turn on. Next, we used code to send a message of \u201cblink\u201d in order to turn on the LED, and from there could change parameters to make it loop or respond to multiple types of messages such as \u201cblinkfast\u201d or \u201cblinkslow.\u201d Finally we connected our LED to a collective network that could be controlled by a dashboard that had options of speed and types of animation. From this dashboard, all the lights in our class could be controlled and synced together. It was helpful having a slow graduation of steps for learning about the range of possibility of one thing such as LEDs. It felt approachable and understandable to focus on one type of function at a time and to work on each step individually and together as a class. CNC \u00b6 During this class we learned about the advantages of using CNC, the anatomy of how they work and a demo on using Rhino CAM to set up a file and simulation. CNC is one of the older technologies for subtractive processes. A main advantage is the consistency and accuracy that CNC can provide, since the material is homogenous and can be controlled through a variety of milling bits. One main difference with CNC than Laser cutting is that with milling bits, a fillet is created and it does not create sharp corners that could be needed for press fitting materials. Because of this, there are options of Dog Bone or T-Bone cuts to have enough overlap and strong connection for press fitting materials together. On the CNC we made the sand sieve and had a step down so that we could place different meshes inside. The shape was inspired by a padel and we have two so we can test out the different sizes. After CNC, we were able to fit in different sizes of mesh and cut an extra piece to secure down the nets. Below are the images of the design process and wooden sieve. Amanda and I made the frame of a heddle loom on CNC based off an open sourced one made here: https://kelliead.github.io/assignment8.html We were able to modify the open source design and make the changes they proposed, since the original design was done with laser cutting. With the CNC we were able to make pockets which make the design more sturdy. We attached dowels and 3d printed parts with a spring that make a ratchet for the turning of the dowels. Overall the two side parts came out well. We used two sizes of drill bits 4mm and 6mm. The 4mm was used to make holes to secure the 15mm piece of wood down and then used as a peck drill to slowly make the small holes for the 3d printed parts. Next, we switched to the 6mm bit to make the pockets and cutout the outline of the design. It was helpful to see the simulation before cutting and understand the order of operation. Week 6 \u00b6 Micro Challenge II \u00b6 The document of our process can be found here: https://github.com/josephinebourghardt/SeaPollution Project Explanation: For this micro challenge, our group wanted to make tools for collecting microplastics at the beach. We have been volunteering with an organization that picks up trash found in the sand and in the rocks at a beach in Barceloneta. While we have been there we noticed how many small plastic pieces were in the sand. Although we pick them up one by one, they get tossed in the general trash and we are unable to know how much is collected or see what could be used with them once collected. We have been prototyping with different nets but wanted a way to visualize the amount of plastic taken, a way to weigh them, and an easy to carry tool to be used at the beach. We designed a series of boxes that have interchangeable nets that allow for different sizes of plastic to fall between each layer. There is also a scale that we made using a load cell and sensor with Arduino. Lastly, we used the CNC to design a hand held tool where nets can also be switched out. Learnings: After making these tools we brought them to the beach to be tested. We learned that the CNC hand held tool is approachable however needs some modification to be able to scoop and be thinner on one side. For the boxes, they need to have mesh that is slightly larger than the smallest size mesh we had. We realized it was difficult to separate the rocks from the plastic, and still requires a human eye to make the distinction. We would like to try to separate plastic from natural materials with salt water next. The clear boxes did make a great display when dumping all the microplastics we had collected and separating out the small from larger ones. Some feedback we got from our presentation was that there could be vibration added to help with shaking each layer. Also that we could have a mesh bag to carry so the sand would easily fall out while collecting.

In order to start prototyping, the board is dependent on the size and capacity needed to power the desired functions. It is important to review the datasheet of your microcontroller to make sure that it has the appropriate memory and power. The topic of open sourcing was discussed because Arduino is an example of opening up black boxes by making their technology available and shareable. This is through making the software easy to access by beginners, the use of community to contribute and share their knowledge, and the amount of general documentation across multiple languages and platforms for how to use this tool. Open sourcing requires you to also make your work open sourced if you modify the tool itself, however with permissive open source licenses you can use the tool without sharing your own. I have not had experience using Arduino or electronics in the past, so for the challenge to produce a song I needed to first understand how to attach the wires and pins to the board. I watched multiple videos and tried to follow diagrams of ESP32 with a buzzer. Once I understood how to follow the diagram and attach the pins it was more clear. I was able to follow the ESP32 Feather diagram to hook up the positive to the GND and negative to a designated pin. However, after placing the code for the pacman song into the Arduino, there were many errors and even though I changed the ports it still would not go through. I tested the board on a classmate\u2019s computer to see if it was the wiring on the board or the code and it was able to play their song easily. We played around with which port and board was selected, and eventually got the right combination. I modified the duration and pitch to see how the song would be manipulated. The videos below show the two changes.

The difference between CPU versus GPU and how they relate to the types of image processing needed to run certain programs. CPU allows for heavier mathematical equations and GPU can calculate many small equations. This relates to how vectors and pixels process information as well. Vector can scale without losing definition and is CPU processed, while Pixels are located on a x, y, z grid are GPU processed. Similarly to vectors and pixels, there are mesh versus nurbs, which are also distinguished by the type of processing. Mesh is defined by points and uses polygons, it is mostly used for STL 3D printing files, but is not good for scaling like pixels. Nurbs is used in surface modeling because it allows you to modify smooth and fluid shapes. I have a lot of experience in 3D modeling with Solidworks and using Keyshot as a rendering software. I wanted to spend the day learning Rhino because it uses Nurbs and is good for modeling organic shapes. I mainly used Solidworks for surface modeling as well, but it is more difficult to make organic shapes. After using it for the day I realized that Rhino is easy to model quickly, however it is difficult to change past decisions because of the feature tree. There was a plate design with water ripples on it that I was trying to replicate. I worked with Paige to think about the shape we wanted to create, because it is something we found for inspiration for our Bio Deisgn Dinner group who is focusing on making tableware that has water elements. At first I drew the outlines of the ripples, but then found the pipe tool that allowed me to build off of some organic lines. I then added some fillets around the edges after combining the separate pieces. Through this exercise I was able to learn about scaling, fillets, manipulating lines and combining solid geometry. I would like to make another version that can be made into a mold that we can use to fill with biomaterial.

A laser cutter is categorized as a CNC machine because it also uses a 3+ axis, and it uses subtractive methods to engrave, mark and cut. We learned about a variety of applications that can be used such as creating living hinges, molds, laminating, and soldering. I am interested in seeing how we can laser cut biomaterials and solder them in order to eliminate glues and stitching. We received a demo for using a vinyl cutter, where we saw an application of it for copper foil to create circuit shapes. Also it can be used as a drawing tool by swapping out the blade for a pen to create computer aided drawings. The cut vinyl can also be used as a simple screen print or masking. I decided to make a 2D mold in acrylic for molding biomaterials. Since most biomaterials need non-stick surfaces, I chose this material and a 5mm thickness so that there could be enough height for the mold. The outlined shape will be able to be filled as a mold, and the subtracted negative space can be used as a stencil or stamp. I created the file in Illustrator and for the machine we use Rhino for printing and preparing the file. There was some trouble shooting needed to be able to cut through the material thickness, it needed multiple passes because it was 5mm. Also in order to read the file, the program was having a difficult time reading the lines to cut. Overall we were able to cut successfully and gain more confidence in using Rhino, printing software, and the laser cutter.","title":"2D Fabrication (Laser, Vinyl)"},{"location":"term2/12-PrototypingforDesign/#inputs-outputs","text":"During this course we learned about inputs and outputs, and how we can use them to sense an environment. Depending on how we change the inputs, it can produce different outputs. For closed loop systems, the device can regulate its output and make decisions based on the new inputs around it without interference. We also learned about sensors and how they are being used in all our devices to collect data. Even if the sensor itself is cheap, the data that it is collecting holds the value. The companies now that own those data sets have the most power. An example of data collection through sensors is biometric data. This can be through collecting our heart rates and how our body might be reacting in certain environments. And also our biometric fingerprint, where they can detect our own personal movements of how your body and hands interact with a device through movement and gestures. Our phones are collecting so much personal data and we are also freely giving access because they are addicting to use. This week instagram asked me to give access to all my photos and videos, and when I chose not to, it was very difficult to use the app without giving consent. When looking closer at what they want, it is for access to your microphone, camera, location and \u201cdepth\u201d information. Even if you have control over what photos are being posted to the public, they have control over all your photos and are now part of their collective dataset. As well as any new data from the sensors on your phone. For the exercise, I worked mostly on the LDR light sensor to be able to detect the amount of light in the room. I was able to modify the code to have less parameters so that the sensor would be mainly detecting dark or light, versus a spectrum of light. There was some difficulty getting the sensor to detect quickly. Since our ESP32 board is 3v and the Arduino is 5v, I tried using different ohm amounts for the resistor to see if it would read better. Below in the videos you can see that the sensor was detecting all the small variables from dim to very bright. We worked together to make another board have a switch to turn on and off the LED. We had difficulty running the code on each computer, so were unable to have them talk to each other. However they were able to work separately for the most part.

These plates are to be used for our intervention of an ocean-themed dinner where the tableware and food courses are made of the same ingredients with a special focus on food waste and regenerative resources. We went through multiple rounds of iterations to figure out what type of mold and plate shapes we wanted to create. Originally we wanted to make a press that could have interchangeable parts to reduce the material impact that molds can create. Our objective was also to create a design that could be easily replicable by others, using just a laser cutter and screws. In order to create a successful 3D shape, we needed to iterate quickly to understand how we could use 2D prototyping to make a 3D object. We did this by iterating with cardboard and wood prototypes before cutting in acrylic. We wanted to make the most out of one mold, so we updated the design from one shape to three shapes that could be modular within themselves. We also did some material tests with calcium carbonate to see how it would stick to acrylic. We tested with parchment paper, cornstarch, and vaseline. To make the design as smooth as possible without wrinkles, we were able to use vaseline and cornstarch as a mold release. We also wanted to incorporate technology into our mold by using a humidity and temperature sensor. Since the material would be taken out of the mold before drying, we could use the sensor to regulate the environment that the materials are in. Eventually we would like to measure the humidity of the material itself. We were able to get the sensor to read the air humidity, but are still having difficulty connecting it to an LCD screen. We tried multiple screens, but need more power in order to have the contrast show up on the screen itself. Learnings: Some key learnings were that the press needed a significant amount of pressure to extract the excess material. Especially because calcium carbonate is a thick material with high viscosity. The screws we used were great to key the mold together, but we needed to use extra clamps to get the excess material out of the mold. A positive was that we were able to take the plates of the mold after forming the shape while the material was still wet. This allows the possibility to produce a lot in a short time, versus 3d printing one plate at a time over a longer period of time. However the downside is the amount of material needed to make one mold. I would still like to find a way to make a mold with minimal plastics and materials that can be reused and reformed into new shapes.. If we can make molds from plaster or ceramics that would be an option for reusable mold materials.

We looked at the pros and cons between materials and types of 3D printing applications. One main takeaway was the infill being a big factor of weight, movement, and strength. The infill amount can be less as long as the bottom and top layers have an appropriate thickness. The object properties can be changed by the infill pattern, depending on how isotropic the pattern is. There should also be a balance between how fast the print is versus the amount of layers. As thinner layers can print faster, however with thicker layers you need less layers. For 3D scanning, meshes are created by calculating points in space. The high number of points, the higher the resolution is. The object I scanned was a crochet sphere I made using amigurumi, a Japanese technique for making 3D knit shapes. I wanted to see how different phone 3D scanners would be able to pick up the texture from the textile and organic shape. I tried multiple scanning apps such as Polycam, Captur3, and WIDAR. I tried with photos and LIDAR, however the auto mode of photo scanning was the most successful. Polycam had the most clear 3D mesh, however I used the mesh from Captur3 because it is a free program for downloading mesh, in this case an .obj file. Next time I would like to capture it with better lighting and less shadows. Despite me using my phone and not a tripod, the software was still able to capture the object well. After, I imported the .obj file into Rhino and edited it to make it watertight. I was able to print it in PLA and at first the material was not sticking well to the print bed. So we updated the settings to be from low to standard and increased the temperature to 215 degrees. Next, I would like to scan a piece that has more holes and bigger textures to see how it can capture them in the 3D scan and print.","title":"3D Fabrication &amp; Scanning"},{"location":"term2/12-PrototypingforDesign/#networking","text":"In this course we learned about what a network is, how they have been designed today and then created our own local network within our class. A network is when data is copied from one place to another, similar to a copy machine. The way they have been designed today has made it so there are multiple copies that are being sent all over the world, as most data is sent to California. Networks are helpful in doing multiple tasks at the same time and to send information quickly. However, when it comes to sending information locally, we are still sending it across multiple oceans or cities because it is how we have designed networks to be. If there were local networks for simple tasks, it would make more sense to have a collection of small networks. In the end the power goes to the companies that have the largest datasets and control over them. Even though these large companies are collecting this data, it does not mean it is necessarily diverse. For our exercise, we first connected our ESP32 feather boards to the local wifi network where we could see our own messages being sent. We then connected to Victor\u2019s IP address as our local server, where we could receive his message. After each of us connected individually to our local server, we could then be assigned to each other and were able to send messages to one another. This exercise helped illustrate the complexity between sending and receiving messages but also how on a small scale you are able to point to where your information is being stored directly.

Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? How can we design the transition towards these worlds? Looking at the world through a lens of design is a double edged sword. On one hand, design is a means of seeing opportunity for efficiency and can make our surroundings more inspiring visually and physically comfortable. However, it also comes from a source of individualism, can be disconnected from nature, and biased with a westernized perspective. In order to move from extraction to regeneration, we need new perspectives of design. First I will look at how systems of capitalism have brought us to where we are today and relate them to our current state of design. Exploring learnings from nature and offering alternative modes of thinking to reconfigure and provide alternative ways out. In Patel and Moore\u2019s \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d, they call out the relationship between humans and nature. They explore the exploitative relationships humans have made through capitalism in correlation with nature, work, care, food, energy, money and lives. Capitalism looks at all of these aspects as opportunities for extraction in the cheapest forms possible to make the most money possible. They define cheapness as a way to fix crisis or a strategy to temporarily fix something, while managing the relationship between life and capitalism. Cheap is a strategy or practice that results in humans and nature having the least compensation or respect as possible. Since there is the constant race of needing to stay relevant in order to compete and be able to afford the world we live in. Design is intertwined with these notions of cheap things because design has been successful and gained value in the eyes of capitalism. It is now used as a means to compete with each other to perform and create at higher levels. Design can become another cheap thing or used as a tool for regeneration and reconfiguration. There is an urgency with capitalism that we live under, and a learned behavior of not having enough time. This lack of time then becomes an excuse to make poor decisions, which in turn capitalism preys on as opportunities to make money when people are in this vulnerable state. For example, fast food preys on this vulnerability and provides an easy but harmful solution. We have been trained to pick the easiest and cheapest route, causing a lack of awareness and stress. This stress then leads to furthering our desire for the easiest way out, which consequently affects other humans and nature in the worst ways. An alternative presence would be to value slowness, relationship, and nature. Can we learn from non-western perspectives to have a healthier relationship with time and break the illusion of urgency we are currently under? Another main issue is how we perceive others around us and specifically in design contexts. In design education, we are taught to think of a user which aims to humanize a hypothesis and reduce bias. The act of picking a user though can be idealized and over simplifies the complexities and range of humans in reality. In terms of marketing, this user is described as an ideal target audience that can have an ideal race, age, and gender attached to it. In digital products, the number of users are looked at as \u201cthe unit of a measurement for entrepreneurial success\u201d (Slavin, 2016). In this case the user is distilled to a number that is in direct relation with money. In order to avoid this narrowing down and over simplification, design can be made in co-creation with the intended users in order to keep in check the complexity and specificity that they are designing towards, allowing for a more nuanced solution. There is also a desire to scale everything up, where in fact having small scale nuanced solutions could be more effective in the long term. When looking at our relationship with nature and resources, design can be used to educate and show possibilities of how we can revalue our waste. We are living with our waste, digesting it and ultimately need to do something about it. Not only do we need to sort, collect and use this waste but design with alternative methods and materials in order to not add to it. We can use tools of tracking waste, transportation, resource management to see how our materials and waste are affecting one another. The waste that western societies are creating are sent directly to developing countries. Waste has been colonized to take precious resources from developing countries, and in turn dump used resources back onto these lands. This extraction of people and land through colonization over the course of history has led us to this ecological crisis. Art and creativity offer an alternative to seeing everything around us as a possibility for new creation. Offering awareness and inspiring action to change the wasteful habits we have become used to. As the planet warms, there is a growing need to design solutions for the global south because natural disasters seem more obvious in these contexts. There is a fine line to be crossed of design being another form of colonization. We have to be careful to not design solutions in western contexts as a type of charity. Changing the thought of helping or improving \u201cothers\u201d to instead be collectively working together to decrease the harmful practices in our world. This need to solve for outside our context could feel rewarding because issues in our own areas can feel too complex to address. Understanding this, addressing as much as we can in our own societies and contexts first is important before assuming solutions for others. From the learnings you find in your own context, parallels then can be made between societies because in the end we are all facing similar problems in different contexts. At the end of the day, we are all humans who need food, shelter, relationships, and suffer from pollution and disease. In a capitalist society it is difficult and daunting to see any way out. These systems are so large and intertwined, and the grief behind the state of the world and climate can be immobilizing. Design itself has been capitalized, and we need new ways to reconfigure our forms of extraction. Looking at Gregory Bateson\u2019s \u201cEcology of Mind\u201d and Donna Haraway\u2019s \u201cStaying in the Trouble,\u201d they both look at the world in respect to nature and the learnings we find among it. Bateson suggests ways for how we could create more healthy societies with a healthy ecology. As each civilization has risen and fallen, it has done so with exploiting other humans and nature. Each new invention makes room for flexibility but also that flexibility leads to other detrimental consequences. Bateson says, \u201cflexibility of the civilization shall match that of the environment to create an ongoing complex system..\u201d The issues we are facing and the people in them are complex and cannot be solved with simplicity. We can no longer design systems for a single user, let alone distill users down to a monetary number. In this fast paced age of instant connection with the internet and social media, ideas are spread quickly. However systems are still disconnected and people are isolated in their filter bubbles. Currently we try to simplify everything, when in fact we need to stay with the complexity and not be so rushed for a quick and easy solution. Bateson suggests that we can have room for technological advancements, as long as societies stay flexible to change and are inclusive of \u201cgenetic and experiential diversity of persons.\u201d In relation to nature, we should limit our use of natural resources and only use them if it is for necessary advancement and define what that advancement is. A new world of design would look at how we can reduce our greed to not over exploit a resource. As well as sitting with complexity and making small flexible solutions, instead of a stressed ad hoc solution to one part of a complex issue. Right now there is an imbalance of flexibility in the distribution of it. Currently the variables in society that should be flexible are not and those that should be steady have been let loose. In our societies we have inflexibility on how one must conduct their lives in order to stay in order and have success, leading to unfair rates of incarceration, homelessness and exclusion. While in relation to how much we are required to work and what we are allowed to take from nature is open and loose. New systems would allow for more flexibility and safety nets for humans to make mistakes, have inclusive and open education, and be working towards an inclusive social system rather than an exclusive one. Teaching people how to exercise their flexibility and freedoms, encouraging new thought, breaking habits, and fostering creativity. When we talk about fostering diversity we also see how people are tackling similar issues, but how do we bridge them together to create more interconnected systems? Open source platforms are a way to build databases of ideas, however we need to do this in a way that preserves local thought and ideas. Giving credit where it is due and being acutely aware of appropriation. One great thing about online communities is that it can allow someone to ask a question where people all over the world can offer ideas and alternative perspectives. This is one way that design is beneficial, it can create spaces that facilitate ideation and problem solving. To do this as a way to empathize and broaden our world view is a way to transition into a more informed and empowered society. Donna Haraway talks about co-creation as a way to create among non-human and human species. But also creating in a community and managing power dynamics within that community. A designer needs to be aware of their ego and place, knowing when to lead and listen. Being upfront with expectations, skills, and offerings in a way that is not imposing or replacing others. Not only are we co-creating with other humans but keeping in check our relationship with nature and how materials, spaces, consumption is not extracting but symbiotic to our surrounding environment. In terms of climate grief and immobilization, offering spaces of community creation can be a way to combat loneliness and overwhelm. Creative expression among communities can spark hope and new ideas. Communities that are accessible to different age groups and encourage multigenerational interaction. Haraway uses the metaphor \u201cstring figuring,\u201d where like we see in nature there is a constant giving and receiving of participation through diversity of knowledge and care. We can create communities that take on collective responsibility not feel that it is any one individual\u2019s problem to be solved. Solving together and uplifting voices brings a hopeful approach in moving forward and resilience to the challenges we will continue to face. Overall, there have been civilizations before us and there will be others after us. Nature is constant and offers many solutions to us as the ultimate teacher of care, diversity, and empathy. Design in an evolving world means embracing the complexity of the issues we face, encouraging grace and safety nets as we move forward with flexibility. Creating with others and striving for symbiotic relationships with nature and listening to local communities. Using the internet to foster creativity rather than isolation and division. With small flexible steps, we can face life and its challenges. Reference: Bateson, Gregory. Steps to an Ecology of Mind. Chicago, University Of Chicago Press, 2000. Haraway, Donna.

Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? How can we design the transition towards these worlds? Looking at the world through a lens of design is a double edged sword. On one hand, design is a means of seeing opportunity for efficiency and can make our surroundings more inspiring visually and physically comfortable. However, it also comes from a source of individualism, can be disconnected from nature, and biased with a westernized perspective. In order to move from extraction to regeneration, we need new perspectives of design. First I will look at how systems of capitalism have brought us to where we are today and relate them to our current state of design. Exploring learnings from nature and offering alternative modes of thinking to reconfigure and provide alternative ways out. In Patel and Moore\u2019s \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d, they call out the relationship between humans and nature. They explore the exploitative relationships humans have made through capitalism in correlation with nature, work, care, food, energy, money and lives. Capitalism looks at all of these aspects as opportunities for extraction in the cheapest forms possible to make the most money possible. They define cheapness as a way to fix crisis or a strategy to temporarily fix something, while managing the relationship between life and capitalism. Cheap is a strategy or practice that results in humans and nature having the least compensation or respect as possible. Since there is the constant race of needing to stay relevant in order to compete and be able to afford the world we live in. Design is intertwined with these notions of cheap things because design has been successful and gained value in the eyes of capitalism. It is now used as a means to compete with each other to perform and create at higher levels. Design can become another cheap thing or used as a tool for regeneration and reconfiguration. There is an urgency with capitalism that we live under, and a learned behavior of not having enough time. This lack of time then becomes an excuse to make poor decisions, which in turn capitalism preys on as opportunities to make money when people are in this vulnerable state. For example, fast food preys on this vulnerability and provides an easy but harmful solution. We have been trained to pick the easiest and cheapest route, causing a lack of awareness and stress. This stress then leads to furthering our desire for the easiest way out, which consequently affects other humans and nature in the worst ways. An alternative presence would be to value slowness, relationship, and nature. Can we learn from non-western perspectives to have a healthier relationship with time and break the illusion of urgency we are currently under? Another main issue is how we perceive others around us and specifically in design contexts. In design education, we are taught to think of a user which aims to humanize a hypothesis and reduce bias. The act of picking a user though can be idealized and over simplifies the complexities and range of humans in reality. In terms of marketing, this user is described as an ideal target audience that can have an ideal race, age, and gender attached to it. In digital products, the number of users are looked at as \u201cthe unit of a measurement for entrepreneurial success\u201d (Slavin, 2016). In this case the user is distilled to a number that is in direct relation with money. In order to avoid this narrowing down and over simplification, design can be made in co-creation with the intended users in order to keep in check the complexity and specificity that they are designing towards, allowing for a more nuanced solution. There is also a desire to scale everything up, where in fact having small scale nuanced solutions could be more effective in the long term. When looking at our relationship with nature and resources, design can be used to educate and show possibilities of how we can revalue our waste. We are living with our waste, digesting it and ultimately need to do something about it. Not only do we need to sort, collect and use this waste but design with alternative methods and materials in order to not add to it. We can use tools of tracking waste, transportation, resource management to see how our materials and waste are affecting one another. The waste that western societies are creating are sent directly to developing countries. Waste has been colonized to take precious resources from developing countries, and in turn dump used resources back onto these lands. This extraction of people and land through colonization over the course of history has led us to this ecological crisis. Art and creativity offer an alternative to seeing everything around us as a possibility for new creation. Offering awareness and inspiring action to change the wasteful habits we have become used to. As the planet warms, there is a growing need to design solutions for the global south because natural disasters seem more obvious in these contexts. There is a fine line to be crossed of design being another form of colonization. We have to be careful to not design solutions in western contexts as a type of charity. Changing the thought of helping or improving \u201cothers\u201d to instead be collectively working together to decrease the harmful practices in our world. This need to solve for outside our context could feel rewarding because issues in our own areas can feel too complex to address. Understanding this, addressing as much as we can in our own societies and contexts first is important before assuming solutions for others. From the learnings you find in your own context, parallels then can be made between societies because in the end we are all facing similar problems in different contexts. At the end of the day, we are all humans who need food, shelter, relationships, and suffer from pollution and disease. In a capitalist society it is difficult and daunting to see any way out. These systems are so large and intertwined, and the grief behind the state of the world and climate can be immobilizing. Design itself has been capitalized, and we need new ways to reconfigure our forms of extraction. Looking at Gregory Bateson\u2019s \u201cEcology of Mind\u201d and Donna Haraway\u2019s \u201cStaying in the Trouble,\u201d they both look at the world in respect to nature and the learnings we find among it. Bateson suggests ways for how we could create more healthy societies with a healthy ecology. As each civilization has risen and fallen, it has done so with exploiting other humans and nature. Each new invention makes room for flexibility but also that flexibility leads to other detrimental consequences. Bateson says, \u201cflexibility of the civilization shall match that of the environment to create an ongoing complex system..\u201d The issues we are facing and the people in them are complex and cannot be solved with simplicity. We can no longer design systems for a single user, let alone distill users down to a monetary number. In this fast paced age of instant connection with the internet and social media, ideas are spread quickly. However systems are still disconnected and people are isolated in their filter bubbles. Currently we try to simplify everything, when in fact we need to stay with the complexity and not be so rushed for a quick and easy solution. Bateson suggests that we can have room for technological advancements, as long as societies stay flexible to change and are inclusive of \u201cgenetic and experiential diversity of persons.\u201d In relation to nature, we should limit our use of natural resources and only use them if it is for necessary advancement and define what that advancement is.

We learned that all data has bias because it is collected by humans, therefore having skewed results, manipulation, or errors. In society we are also currently adding to datasets without consent or knowledge because of the constant input and interaction we have when using the internet. The internet is based on an economy of data where there are levels of closed, open and shared sources of data. Data is just a collection of information, but can be interpreted and used to expose things for progress or be used against people. Although companies are gaining more and more information about us, we have little knowledge about who they are and what they are doing with this data. This course helped show how easily data is collected, can be interpreted, and the difficulties in making holistic sense of it. We divided into groups and came up with a hypothesis that we were interested in answering through data collection and analysis. Our group was interested in how a space could trigger curiosity and creativity. This being an abstract concept to define made it difficult to narrow down goals and specific measures we wanted to collect. However after having the camera as our tool of collection, we were able to experiment and collect data quickly. Through iterations we made a display that asked a question and prompted people with a QR code. We had a hidden camera that captured how many people interacted with the sign, and had the QR code record the number of scans. We tried this in different settings of the school and coffee shop Itnig. Details on the process can be found in the link below. This challenge made me more aware of the lack of privacy and constant surveillance we are surrounded by. With using QR codes it showed how trusting we are with these codes that have become part of everyday life. When trying to prove a hypothesis with data, it was easy to make broad claims or assumptions, since complex interactions are distilled to a number. I am interested in learning more about data visualization tools because they are powerful in bringing awareness of an issue or topic.

She shared her experience in \u201cLiving in a Prototype,\u201d where she converted a van into a living space and continued to iterate and update the van while living in it. She talked about this design experience as having reciprocal shaping, growing uniqueness, and being consistently unfinished. Through autoethnography and first person design, it is less about the end product and more of the journey and documentation towards your findings and adaptations. The design is constantly evolving and shaping, because it is your own journey it makes it unique to your own needs and discovery. Some takeaways and tips from her talk was to commit to a form of documentation and have it be something that is simple and enjoyable. Also within this to set a specific time frame so that the task can be constrained, while still leaving it flexible for change. I appreciated that she documented her journey on Instructables as a way for her to share her findings and open her design process. It also allowed for input from others who had similar experiences or were facing similar challenges. Audrey also shared examples of people documenting their process through a reflection template that stored photos and specific data, and also a pre-made book \u201cRep(air)\u201d that could be used to fill out. http://audreydesjardins.com/ 23/01 Laura Forlano \u00b6 Auto-ethnography - Living as a Disabled Cyborg Reflection: Laura Forlano talked about interactive machines and reclaiming what it means to be a cyborg. She mentioned Donna Harraway as someone who reclaimed the term cyborg and re-imagined this term positively through a feminist lens. Laura talked about how we can look at machines in the care industry and how the internet community can come together to talk about medical issues and rare diseases. She asked the question if AI can be disabled? This was interesting because there is the myth of technology being perfect when in fact it has many biases. It brings up the ethical questions about AI and who it is excluding or leaving behind. This talk made me question how designers could work with data collection as a way to collaborate and improve medical systems to be more ethical and sustainable. The vast amount of data and feedback we could retrieve from people using medical devices could be used as real time feedback as these devices are being designed. I wondered how she might use this data to communicate with those designing and engineering these products. It seems that there is still a disconnect of information we are able to collect and how we can implement it. Especially for the medical field which has many regulations depending on countries and companies. https://lauraforlano.org/ 30/01 Fred Van Amstel \u00b6 Monster Aesthetics Reflection: This talk brought up how colonization impacts our own body, its effect on design as a whole and relationship with politics. It made me think of the importance of recognizing how design and politics are related and to continue questioning how design involves our own privileges and biases. Is there a way that we can design with communities especially of minority or oppressed groups, that is not a form of extraction or another form of colonization? He talked about this contradiction that we have within ourselves and we are to balance these two forces. We should question our role and positionality as we continue with interventions and collaborations with others. https://fredvanamstel.com/ https://designjustice.org/ 20/02 Julia Ballesteros and Milena Ros\u00e9s \u00b6 Tierra de Arcillas Reflection: Julia and Milena shared their story of questioning how clay was made and finding clay back in their hometown of \u00cdllar, La Alpujarra. Through questioning the resources they were using in industrial ceramic making and talking to locals back in their hometown they learned how to source their own clay, run workshops, and find meaning in their ceramic making. There was an emphasis on the interactions with local and older generations that hold knowledge that may be overlooked or dismissed. When it comes to making with local resources and community it takes questioning and seeking from all around you in order to co-create in a meaningful and respectful way. Their journey was very inspiring and a reminder to look at inspiration of your own past, hometown and those around you.

We started with the making section and worked our way clockwise to answer each section of Making, Knowledge, Power, and Value. Learning Skills: Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? For our activity there needed to be some knowledge about ChatGPT in order to contribute to the mushroom model. It also helps to understand current business models, technical terms, current trends, and knowledge of how things are made. Soft skills of listening and adding onto the ideas of others, while encouraging each other to share their opinions in a collaborative way are also important. Dynamics: How was the dynamic inside the group? Our group was open to each other\u2019s perspective and ideas. We brainstormed together to answer the questions in the model and worked on each section together. Each of us brought our own understanding about ChatGPT, which in itself is an abstract product. Having a variety of perspectives helped to fill out the mushroom model and draw conclusions about ChatGPT in relation of how it can be made, the knowledge needed for it, where the power lies, and what values are held by it. Interactions: Did the role I played influence my opinion? Having a more critical view of ChatGPT influenced my perspective and contributions to the discussion. However my role I played was also to listen and ask questions among our team to understand their ideas and perspective. Reflection 2: Reflection Tree \u00b6 For the reflection tree, I scored myself around the project with Crafting Community with Amanda, and then after we both compared our scores to each other on the same project. Learning Skills: With this exercise, the skills needed were to understand the values enough to critique my current project being evaluated. It was helpful to have the questions for each value broken down into specifics and to have vocabulary used among the questions to later be used to describe the project\u2019s plan to others. After the evaluation, communicating the feelings and opportunities for growth was important in understanding what areas to improve on for the project. In the future using this tool will be helpful when starting new projects and to give vocabulary to describe the values that need to be evaluated or improved. Dynamics: Within our group of sharing each person\u2019s reflection tree, we were able to each highlight areas we wanted to improve upon. With each topic, we were able to shed light on how they are already achieving this value in a different way then they saw originally. Also it was helpful to see how not all values needed to be prioritized, and that in order to move forward it is good to acknowledge areas of growth but also understand what values were most needed. Interactions: It was helpful to evaluate individually and then compare scores of Amanda and I about our same project. This helped to see that we were aligned and we ended up having very similar scores and highlighted areas that we wanted to keep in mind as we moved forward with the project. Reflection 3: Value \u00b6 This photo is of the collage made by our group that focused on the value of Justice. Learning Skills: During this activity, the skills needed were to distill abstract information and to summarize the wide range of perspectives and ideas that came from this activity. For our group this was difficult because justice could be applied in many ways and we spent more time discussing what justice meant to us rather than how it could be measured as a value. We learned new ways of looking at justice and could take the learnings from this discussion to further develop a set of measurables. Dynamics: Inside the group we had a good dynamic with lots of sharing and perspectives. We each took turns to talk about what we first thought of when thinking about justice. Whether it was about law, personal experiences with injustices, how to balance forgiveness and accountability, and how justice could be applied to all areas of design. We discovered how grounding justice is in terms of meaning and bringing to light the positive and negatives of projects and their impact. Interactions: During our discussion I was listening and reflecting on the ideas brought up from our group and what justice meant to me. As a role I tried to think of ways to synethesize all of the learnings from our group discussion, however we needed more time to summarize. By making a collage, it was helpful to put these abstract concepts into images and texts.

We started with the making section and worked our way clockwise to answer each section of Making, Knowledge, Power, and Value. Learning Skills: Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? For our activity there needed to be some knowledge about ChatGPT in order to contribute to the mushroom model. It also helps to understand current business models, technical terms, current trends, and knowledge of how things are made. Soft skills of listening and adding onto the ideas of others, while encouraging each other to share their opinions in a collaborative way are also important. Dynamics: How was the dynamic inside the group? Our group was open to each other\u2019s perspective and ideas. We brainstormed together to answer the questions in the model and worked on each section together. Each of us brought our own understanding about ChatGPT, which in itself is an abstract product. Having a variety of perspectives helped to fill out the mushroom model and draw conclusions about ChatGPT in relation of how it can be made, the knowledge needed for it, where the power lies, and what values are held by it. Interactions: Did the role I played influence my opinion? Having a more critical view of ChatGPT influenced my perspective and contributions to the discussion. However my role I played was also to listen and ask questions among our team to understand their ideas and perspective.","title":"Reflection 1: Mushroom Model"},{"location":"term3/18-DistributedDesign/#reflection-2-reflection-tree","text":"For the reflection tree, I scored myself around the project with Crafting Community with Amanda, and then after we both compared our scores to each other on the same project. Learning Skills: With this exercise, the skills needed were to understand the values enough to critique my current project being evaluated. It was helpful to have the questions for each value broken down into specifics and to have vocabulary used among the questions to later be used to describe the project\u2019s plan to others. After the evaluation, communicating the feelings and opportunities for growth was important in understanding what areas to improve on for the project. In the future using this tool will be helpful when starting new projects and to give vocabulary to describe the values that need to be evaluated or improved. Dynamics: Within our group of sharing each person\u2019s reflection tree, we were able to each highlight areas we wanted to improve upon. With each topic, we were able to shed light on how they are already achieving this value in a different way then they saw originally. Also it was helpful to see how not all values needed to be prioritized, and that in order to move forward it is good to acknowledge areas of growth but also understand what values were most needed. Interactions: It was helpful to evaluate individually and then compare scores of Amanda and I about our same project. This helped to see that we were aligned and we ended up having very similar scores and highlighted areas that we wanted to keep in mind as we moved forward with the project.","title":"Reflection 2: Reflection Tree"},{"location":"term3/18-DistributedDesign/#reflection-3-value","text":"This photo is of the collage made by our group that focused on the value of Justice. Learning Skills: During this activity, the skills needed were to distill abstract information and to summarize the wide range of perspectives and ideas that came from this activity. For our group this was difficult because justice could be applied in many ways and we spent more time discussing what justice meant to us rather than how it could be measured as a value. We learned new ways of looking at justice and could take the learnings from this discussion to further develop a set of measurables. Dynamics: Inside the group we had a good dynamic with lots of sharing and perspectives. We each took turns to talk about what we first thought of when thinking about justice. Whether it was about law, personal experiences with injustices, how to balance forgiveness and accountability, and how justice could be applied to all areas of design. We discovered how grounding justice is in terms of meaning and bringing to light the positive and negatives of projects and their impact. Interactions: During our discussion I was listening and reflecting on the ideas brought up from our group and what justice meant to me.

The benefits of using a robotic arm versus other methods of manufacturing is the flexibility in multiple axises. Similar to a CNC, it has multiple end effectors however provides other opportunities such as antigravity printing. Through Grasshopper we saw how to create simulations and played around with scripts to see how the parameters could be controlled and modified. When creating a path to join points together it also can be made through determining the joing curve between the points, verses a linear path. This curve, or spline, should also be converted to have each point determined with the corrosponding plane. In the Grasshopper simulation file, I was able to download the plugins and libraries for robotics. I was able to run the script that draws a line in space. The images for running the scrips can be found below. Blender \u00b6 In this class we learned the origins of Blender, the community behind it, and the variety of applications that can be done using it. In picking a design tool, it is important to pick a tool that can you can learn from and be applied in multiple ways. For Blender it is used for animation, CAD, rendering, and can be connected to a multitude of devices and interfaces. There are a lot of tools that sell instant gratifaction of making something easy, and often times we donnot want to spend the time to learn a tool because it is not intuitive. However, this easyness that is offered is more about wanting a quick solution and to boost the user\u2019s ego. In the end, we know less and less about how things are working and because of this are limiting our overall potential of skills and making. Interfaces \u00b6 This course we learned about live coding and used a visualizing tool called Hydra to learn how we can manipulate and create our own live visuals. We were able to edit existing visuals, write from scratch, use our own cameras and have the visuals be controlled by sound inputs. Coming from a non-coding background it was helpful to see how each command would change the visuals and parameters. It helped to understand the direct relationship and possibilities of what could be made using these tools. Blender + Interfaces \u00b6 During this session we started using Blender and learned basic functions in moving models in space and created an array. We were able to to this using coding commands which showed the foundation of how Blender works. Unlike other CAD and rendering programs, Blender has a lot of ways to interact with it. We then saw how Arduino can be connected to Blender, using a switch modeled in Blender it could control a light on Arduino. In the images below it shows the demo of the Blender interface that would control the light switch. We had some difficulty in setting up the light on Arduino, however it was good to see another way that these tools could be used together and applied. Overall it made me interested in learning Blender.","title":"Prototyping for Design II"},{"location":"term3/19-PrototypingforDesignII/#prototyping-for-design","text":"","title":"Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term3/19-PrototypingforDesignII/#robots","text":"Today we had an introduction to robotics and learned about robotic arms.
