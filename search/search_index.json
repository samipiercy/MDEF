I have used the first and third types of prototypes the most \u2013prototype as an experimental component and prototype as a research archetype. I have prototyped as an experimental component to test ergonomics and physical feasibility through frankenstein mock ups of a variety of materials such as 3d prints, wood, foam, metals, or scrap parts. These are to test the basic shape, scale, function, and look of an object for product design purposes. These prototypes were to test a hypothesis about if a concept was feasible, for example, if a specific shape of a container could preserve vegetables in the fridge longer. Or if a certain length or orientation of a handle made it easier or harder to be used. Prototype as a research archetype was used by creating prototypes that showed the possibility of a concept that was yet to exist. For example, mocking up 3D prints to appear like metal, plastic or fabric thicknesses and seeing how parts could be combined or mixed and matched. Or a medical boot concept from renderings and cardboard prototypes, which mocked up a new way of customizing your own medical boot using a moldable plastic. Which ones haven\u2019t you used and how do you think they could be interesting for you? The second or fourth types I have used the least \u2013prototype as a means of inquiry and the process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry. The second type will be interesting to create ways to collect types of data. Such as some type of technology or empathy probe that can create a reaction that is measured. By measuring an emotional connection, it can give a more holistic idea to how a hypothesis is being encountered. As well as showing how people are being transformed by an experience or object. The fourth type is interesting to see how the process itself can be analyzed by showing how something was created, by documenting the journey and research behind an artifact. What are the main roles of prototyping, combinations of them and other design activities that you want to use? I would like to start with the third and fourth types of prototyping, to gather insight on my research direction and to document the process of inquiry. I would like to continue to use prototype four with the other three types to continue to document throughout different stages. I would use prototype two and one to test specific hypotheses and to ask and gather information through interviews and questionnaires. Personal Workspace \u00b6 Communication Strategy \u00b6 Below are the communication strategies I am planning for: Open Design Processes: Understand your audience: As a first step, I am looking to continue interviewing people that may relate to my interests and project, through faculty and MDEF connections. I want to understand what is currently happening in Barcelona, past projects, and learn from people working in similar fields. I am also engaging in local events that relate to waste and volunteering with current groups providing services for underserved communities. Experiential prototypes & compiling material samples: As part of my process I will start to experiment with materials and resources that I find interesting and take photos and videos of my process. Currently I am interested in craft and sustainable materials. There is a lot of biomaterial research that I am open to exploring, as it is a new area of interest for me. I am also interested in textiles and will start my own personal textile project to get into a creative mindset that is not pressured by school or income, but could spark future ideas. Communication Medium: Graphics or drawings to understand the process and concept: I plan to map my interests and connections as they continue to evolve. I will physically draw out these maps to have a visual representation of my thought process. Social media presence to document and show process and journey: I will use social media as a way to document and share my MDEF journey. I would like to eventually build an identity that is accessible to past colleagues and designers as a way to engage with current industry, but that also shows my work and development. Collective Design Intervention \u00b6 As the Hack the Supply Chain group we made our first intervention by cooking a dinner together using collected food waste scraps. This started because we were curious about why we value parts of a vegetable or fruit as \u201cwaste\u201d and wondered what we could create out of this so-called \u201cwaste.\u201d For a week we each saved up our peels, stale bread, wilting fruits and vegetables. We each picked a recipe to make and cooked them simultaneously. By cooking together we were able to improvise, and collaborate on the recipes together. Some dishes followed an exact recipe, while others changed depending on what ingredients we had and the motivation to use as much of it as possible. We were all surprised at how much food we ended up making and that we were able to use almost everything we brought. We were also surprised with how good everything looked and tasted. This first intervention was a good way to start testing out a question. Even though we weren\u2019t all interested in food specifically, it was something universal that could be related to by everyone. It helped to bring up other questions that relate to supply chains and society\u2019s conditioning. Such as, how we were taught about what to throw away and what to keep, what expiration dates really mean, and how packaging could be improved. Here are images from before, and after cooking:","title":"Design Studio I"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio/#design-studio-framing-design-interventions","text":"","title":"Design Studio: Framing Design Interventions"},{"location":"term1/02-Design%20Studio/#roles-of-prototyping","text":"Which types of prototypes have you used and for what purposes?

To me Welfare State 2.0 means the general well being of citizens and what the future looks like for people on the margins of society. What does it look like for equality of all peoples, genders, ages, races. I chose the second card, Climate Conscience, because I also want to relate to sustainability of the planet and how we use resources, materials, and live among nature. My design space is currently a brainstorm with general ideas at the top filtering to more specific ideas below. For Welfare State 2.0, I have the triggers: Wellness Tech, Food Apartheids, Nomadic Design, and Inclusivity Activism. My past experience has been working on projects related to unhoused peoples and seeing how resources can be accessible as well as finding ways to engage with people sleeping rough in cities. I also have some experience working with women and children from an indigenous group in Bolivia. I have other interests in prevention of food waste and have done many projects related to cooking and food prep. When living in Cleveland there were many food desserts that came along with gentrification and the segregation of societies. There are so many specific issues to address, but for now I would like to broaden my scope to looking at nomadic lifestyles and wellness.

Within my second area of Climate Conscience I have the trigger cards: Craftivism and Local Materials Recirculation. My past experience is working a lot with manufacturing of plastics and metals. I have seen the unsustainable processes that go into making a product from start to finish and have a lot of knowledge about manufacturing. Using my knowledge of production cycles, I can see how new materials or alternative methods could be applied to have a sustainable outcome. I am interested in textiles and making things by hand in a way that teaches new skills. I have experience with weaving and sewing, and would like to learn other types of textile making.

The second photo is a view of a ovary slice through a microscope. Both were interseting to see the intricacies and details close up through isolation and microscopic views. Article \u00b6 The article I chose is from The Guardian, Geddes (2022), \u201cNext pandemic may come from melting glaciers, new data shows.\u201d In summary it is about how melting glaciers are exposing ancient viruses. It suggests that as these viruses defrost, they could potentially infect surrounding wildlife causing the spread of infectious diseases or start another pandemic. The main scientific study the article references is a genetic analysis done for soil and lake sediments of Lake Hazen, which is a large Arctic freshwater lake. They talk about a process called \u201cviral spillover\u201d which is when a spectrum of viruses from a reservoir is then transmitted and infects a new host, which could then infect others. Due to climate change and warmer temperatures, they are trying to quantify the spillover potential. For this study they focused on soil and lake sediments. Using DNA and RNA sequencing they created an algorithm seeing how these viruses could potentially infect a range of hosts. They also estimated how much risk of spillover there is and how much the risk of spillover could increase from the runoff of glacier melt. This points to climate change as the cause of the spread of new viruses or pandemics. The research was done by scientists from the University of Ottawa and published in The Royal Society journal. The article also references examples of unknown viruses frozen in glaciers. An example of a virus infecting a nomadic group of people in arctic regions in northern Siberia, although the reference is from over six years ago. As well as, a finding from Ohio State University of an ice sample from the Tibetan plateau in China which had 28 novel viruses found, estimated to be 15,000 years old. Although the data collected shows potential risk of virus transmission due to climate change from spillover, it is still a simulation and has not happened yet. There is still a low chance of it being as dramatic as it seems. There are still many unknowns and the article is shedding light on how it is important to continue to study microorganisms all over the world as we are in a state of constant change due to climate change. The Arctic is warming up and there are many potential risks that can happen as it becomes thawed and microorganisms are no longer dormant. I looked into an article from Nature, which talks about the Arctic melting to see if there are any similar findings that could back up the article from The Guardian. In the Nature article \u201cEmergent biogeochemical risks from Arctic permafrost degradation,\u201d from 2021. This article talks about permafrost which is a permanently frozen layer underneath Earth\u2019s visible surface. They talk about a variety of potentially hazardous bacterias, chemicals, and viruses that have been dormant in the permafrost. In the diagram Fig.2, they show potential hazards of smallpox virus, Clostridium bacteria, and Alphaproteobacteria. It also shows nuclear waste and ancient DNA from dead animals. Clostridium bacteria is one of the leading causes for foodborne illnesses. This article talks about how there are methuselah microorganisms which have been able to stay around for millions of years. As the thawing continues, it increases activity of these dormant microorganisms which can cause change from the bottom up as the thawing is causing change from the top down, overall causing quicker changes within the permafrost and thawing layers. My findings from these two articles show a variety of potential risks and unknowns about the Arctic and what it holds. Typically when hearing about glacier melting we hear how it affects animals and habitats. However, understanding that there are century old microorganisms, viruses, and chemicals that we will have to face as the Arctic melts, is something that should be shared more as a dangerous consequence of climate change.

And why did it matter? \u201cHow can I use natural elements to inform my food prep?\u201d I spent the day buying, prepping, and cooking food in rudimentary ways. This mattered to look at ordinary tasks and see how they could be causing so much waste. With convenience and disassociation with our food and where it comes from, I wanted to create parameters to be forced to make decisions that were zero waste of packaging and electricity and use foods that had no waste to them as well. What happens when you involve yourself? By involving myself I had to give myself parameters which forced me to think creatively and confront my own habits and personal comforts. I also had my own expectations, that were confronted with what I could do in reality. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I used myself as a test by trying out this idea on myself, my routine and what I would be eating throughout the day. It highlights my own discomforts, feelings, and biases by using myself as an instrument for this process. Did anything change about your way of working? I had different expectations of buying the food and originally was focused more on going to different places to find bulk food. However after making the coffee and using the mortar & pestle I decided to incorporate it more as a tool and parameter for creativity. Later in the day I started to get more ideas for what to make and how I could use up all that I had bought to cook with. What does it mean for your future work? In the future I will test an idea or parameters on myself first to see how I react and how they change my perspective on my hypothesis, to gain empathy, or have new insight on who I might involve next. Instead of over-thinking or planning out an idea too far out, I think it\u2019s important to test something even if the idea is not fully formed. After seeing the videos of your design space collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration? There were a lot of videos surrounding waste as a topic from reusing wasted water, to understanding how much water it takes to make up the food and objects we own, waste in fashion to fulfill an impulse, and reducing what we really needed for the day. I think the topic of waste is a theme and it was inspiring to see how many ways it could be approached.","title":"Living with Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living With Your Own Ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#1-min-video","text":"","title":"1 min video"},{"location":"term1/05-LivingWithIdeas/#reflection","text":"What did you make? And why did it matter? \u201cHow can I use natural elements to inform my food prep?\u201d I spent the day buying, prepping, and cooking food in rudimentary ways. This mattered to look at ordinary tasks and see how they could be causing so much waste. With convenience and disassociation with our food and where it comes from, I wanted to create parameters to be forced to make decisions that were zero waste of packaging and electricity and use foods that had no waste to them as well. What happens when you involve yourself? By involving myself I had to give myself parameters which forced me to think creatively and confront my own habits and personal comforts. I also had my own expectations, that were confronted with what I could do in reality. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? I used myself as a test by trying out this idea on myself, my routine and what I would be eating throughout the day. It highlights my own discomforts, feelings, and biases by using myself as an instrument for this process. Did anything change about your way of working? I had different expectations of buying the food and originally was focused more on going to different places to find bulk food. However after making the coffee and using the mortar & pestle I decided to incorporate it more as a tool and parameter for creativity. Later in the day I started to get more ideas for what to make and how I could use up all that I had bought to cook with. What does it mean for your future work? In the future I will test an idea or parameters on myself first to see how I react and how they change my perspective on my hypothesis, to gain empathy, or have new insight on who I might involve next. Instead of over-thinking or planning out an idea too far out, I think it\u2019s important to test something even if the idea is not fully formed.

We started with a forensic report of a broken item, and followed with creating an Almost Useful Machine. Below are presentations of each project followed by my reflection. Forensic Report \u00b6 We began the first week choosing an item that had stopped working to disassemble. Our item was a Sports Blender by Electrolux, which was surprisingly difficult to take a part. While disassembling the casing, we came across a single screw (spanner slotted) which is typically used to prevent tampering. This tiny screw made it impossible to take a part the casing, and it resulted in us using a drill and saw to break the base open. We also learned that this particular blender failed because there was a nut bolt piece that had misaligned due to overheating of the PP material encasing it. Although the item was filled with metal and copper parts, this one area of plastic made the item fail. This material choice may be because they intended the blender to be used less frequent because it was designed for a single serving. Older and more robust blenders have the intention of serving larger quantities, so glass or harder materials are used. This item seemed to be targetting individuals who wanted a cheaper and quick solution to make protein shakes or smoothies, but in the end the item was designed to be short lived and unable to be repaired. Our Foresnic Report can be found here: Forensic Report Distracted Timer - Almost Useful Machine \u00b6 After learning about motors from our broken blender, we used a windshield wiper motor to create a distracted timer. Using Arduino and sensors, we were able to make our almost useful machine. Initially we were playing around with how to make the motor turn different dirrections and how we could make it feel random. We coded the amount of time it would turn a direction and also played with a manual switch which would reverse the energy, and make the motor reverse. We followed with brainstorming concepts and ideas that were interesting to us as a group and landed on making something that would be annoying to us. The initial timer was able to change directions based on the code, however we added the sensor element to create more of a random and personification of the timer itself. The presentation can be found here: Presentation Video Motor hooked up to Arduino Cardboard mockup Reflection \u00b6 This week was very interesting for me because although I have taken a part and built products in industrial design, I am less familiar with electronics. Learning about AC vs. DC motors was new to me as well as working with Arduino. There was a steep learning curve to understand how we could control a motor using code. First was understanding how to make the motor run from a battery, and then learning how we could connect that power to Arduino for it to be controlled. Once we were able to map out how the electricity would flow it made a lot more sense and was a great way to visualize how energy flows from one element to another. It was also exciting to figure out how to make the motor turn different directions and brainstorm what else we could make it do. The topic of the right to repair is really interesting to me and from an industrial design perspective is something that gets pushed aside in the design process when it comes to cost of material and manufacturing. So many products are designed to work for a short period of time and do not give agency to the user when it comes to taking it a part and fixing it. Also with everything being encased in \u201cblack boxes\u201d we are taught to make things look simple and seamless, when in fact that communicates to the user that they should not interfere with understanding how the product is working.","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"This seminar we learned about the right to repair, black boxes, how things are made, and how we can combine code with machines.

It was helpful to think about how to practically work with stakeholders that have their own motivations and maneuver between a variety of perspectives and needs within a community project. We did a hypothetical role playing of stake holders that would work with a local building and residency. Acting out how each role would interact with each other, and understanding each role\u2019s needs and motivations. I enjoyed visiting local places in Poblenou that have created open spaces for artists and the surrounding neighborhood to collaborate. Two of the places we visited were working with food waste and biomaterials to make products, education, and designs. Poblenou has an interesting dynamic with the gentrification of tech, it was good to see artist spaces and organizations that are working to keep historical buildlings preserved and think about what role artists play in that preservation. Intervention Outline Community Framework \u00b6 Exercise on engaging with local community: Creative community: I am interested in working with local communities who work with people that have been marginalized or have difficulty meeting their basic needs. Context: Each city has their own social dynamics that contribute to the wellbeing of specific communities. Whether it is by race, gender, or socio-economic status, there is an imbalance of opportunity and services for specific groups of people. Coming from Seattle where there is an increasing gap of rich vs. poor, gentrification, and a growing population of people experiencing homelessness, I am curious to know in Barcelona what the dynamics and situations are here. Current situation: From my current and limited understanding, there is a large population of migrant workers and refugees. There are marginalized groups of people based on their race, socio-economic status, and legal documentation. There are people living on the street but also services addressing food and shelter in their own ways. It seems that there is community involvement in many areas, but the communication between services is still limited as each group is addressing issues in their own way. Engagement & Limits: Takes time to engage and understand the current situation and organizations. I am an outsider and come with my own biases, understandings, and interpretations. I understand that I will make my own judgements before fully understanding the whole situation, and need to be aware of those. Theory of change: Connecting services to one another and drawing bridges between different organizations could help to make sure there are no gaps of people being reached out to or addressed. It also could help to create ways of collaboration between multiple organizations. Design challenges & opportunities: The main challenge is to first engage and observe, because there may be a desire for design but it is more important to understand these situations before jumping to any action. At this stage it is most important to be a listener, open minded, and learn from others. 4D Model - Social Presencing Workshop \u00b6 The following images are from our 4D map performing an embodiment of what \u201chigher education\u201d looks like.

That we should view futures as a way for invention and imagination, rather than just prevention. We also learned about reframing design as a verb rather than a noun, that design is a practice that helps one make choices. These choices we are designing for are to create change systematically and not just solution-based. A quote that was shared with us by Eduardo Galeano said \u201cI don\u2019t believe in charity. I believe in solidarity. Charity is so vertical. It goes from the top to the bottom. Solidarity is horizontal. It respects the other person. I have a lot to learn from other people.\u201d This quote was meaningful to me because traditionally design is seen as a solution-based, top down approach where it can feel disconnected from who you are designing for. It is important to not see design as a sort of \u2018charity\u2019 that is just improving things around us, but rather that we are designing in solidarity with the world around us.

We also wrote a letter to our current selves, from the perspective of our future self. This writing exercise gave perspective to how short our lives are but also encouragement to do all that I can now, with the resources and privileges around me. It gave perspective that our world is finite and will be a harder place to live, so there is urgency in how we enjoy and preserve it now. In learning about critical hope, for a group project we put together a presentation of a time capsule that was opened in 2054 and how our world might look differently if the world around us adopted principles of critical hope and regrowth. Our group thought about how there may be multiple seasons in the future, not just the traditional four. That the seasons would be dictated by things around us that we would need to pay more attention to, such as trees, the tide, and the temperature.

Description: Mesh bag containing tea leaves, heat sealed together and tied onto cotton string. This particular tea bag is in a pyramid shape, which is marketed to allow tea leaves to brew better by having more surface area in the bag to expand. Story: Tea bags were first claimed to be invented in 1904 in the US as a more convenient way to drink tea with easy cleanup and for single serving purposes. Material for nylon, PET, polypropylene, cotton or paper have been used. Many paper tea bags have a lining of polypropylene inside, making them non compostable. Filter paper is made with thermoplastics in order to make it thermosealing and have strong fibers. Unfortunately having plastic in the tea bags makes it so your tea is filled with microplastics that are ingested with the tea, but also poured down drains and into landfills. Thermosealing paper for tea bags patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0380127A2/en Applications: - Nylon bags can be heat sealed together to be upcycled for reusable produce bags - Upcycled thermosealing paper could be used as a textile for artificial plants or flowers Reference: https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/some-plastic-your-tea-300919 Reference material: Algae sequins by Carolyn Raff Properties: Algae agar, cut into sequins for garments and textile, added onto linen-blended materials. The sequins are biodegradable, and able to have a variety of colors with added natural dyes. Gives an intriguing emotion with the natural but futuristic look of the material and variety of colors and textures. Description: The shape and layering of the sequins give depth and movement. The translucent effect gives the sequins a lot of depth, with the mix of textured to glossy shimmers. Story: Made by Carolyn Raff, who wanted to use materials from the ocean to show possibilities of what could be made from ocean-based materials. She wanted to make sustainable sequins made from a raw material. She used agar because it is readily available, can be manipulated easily, and can be mixed with other colors and materials. Applications: - Algae bioplastic sheets could be used for cosmetic packaging - Algae sequins could be used for home decor like lighting, curtains, decoration Reference: https://www.materialsource.co.uk/carolyn-raff-on-biomaterials-sustainable-manufacturing-and-baking-sequins/ https://www.sourcegreen.co/food-packaging/10-seaweed-packaging-startups-algae/ Ideal material: Biodegradable silicone for kid products Properties: Flexible, waterproof, easy to sterilize/antibacterial, heat resistant, bouncy and durable. Can be made in multiple colors and formed easily into shapes and molds, has similar emotional properties of feeling healthier while being easy to clean. Description: This material is approachable by kids and their parents, because it can be molded into flexible shapes with a variety of colors. Story: As babies and kids grow up the items around them do not need to last forever, since they are constantly evolving and needing different things. There is a lot of waste in toys and gear for kids, but also a lot of plastic that can be easily ingested. By having a biomaterial alternative it is healthier for the kids and the environment.. Applications: - Sippy cups or tableware that is easy to clean and and flexible so they are harder to break - Biodegradable toys, that can be composted when no longer needed or as the kid grows up","title":"Remixing Materials"},{"location":"term2/11-RemixingMaterials/#remixing-materials","text":"","title":"Remixing Materials"},{"location":"term2/11-RemixingMaterials/#material-naratives","text":"Material around me: tea bags Properties: Nylon, paper, cotton string, resistant to heat, mesh properties, light weight, water resistant.
